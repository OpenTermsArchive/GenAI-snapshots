Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search" target="_blank">scrape</a> our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.</p><h3 class="bt n">Safety and integrity</h3><p class="z">For example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.</p><h3 class="bt n">Advertising</h3><p class="z">For example, you may also see ads for the Meta Company Products shown through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768/?helpref=search" target="_blank">Meta Audience Network</a> when you visit other apps if we can't recognise you as a registered user of the Meta Products.</p><h3 class="bt n">Performance</h3><p class="z">For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don't have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks. </p></div><div class="bf"><div class="bg" id="annotation-5">5</div><h2 class="bh n">Information that you provide</h2><p class="z">For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, such as a password and your email address or phone number.

So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you.</li><li class="y">If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.</li><li class="y">If you've recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.</li><li class="y">You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. So if you're near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium. <a href="#2.subpage.6-HowWeUseLocation">Learn more</a> about how we use location-related information.</li></ul><h2 class="bh n">Take control</h2><div class="ba"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/964154640320617/control-what-you-see-in-news-feed" target="_blank"><div class="bb"><div class="bc"><span class="bd"> How to manage your Facebook Feed </span></div><span class="be"><img src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/y6/r/arJG_EHnffQ.png" width="24" height="24" class="l"></span></div></a><a href="https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F505299634436870%2F%3Fparent_cms_id%3D1986234648360433&amp;h=AT0RjbnP2-V5KxWccGOWBSmTP08KRMfEt7ZNL7tIdgr9BfjXEa0aW-rz136aIkJa9tZFbrLzUQzn58RjsSs7fAfmBcuLhBYg55Q555cFoFfHwMMICT45xAll9TpQ8XjYt8pxfk3r9SHkCDOyv6R2bUSv03ZotS0AFezT1g" target="_blank"><div class="bb"><div class="bc"><span class="bd"> How to manage your Instagram Feed </span></div><span class="be"><img src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/y6/r/arJG_EHnffQ.png" width="24" height="24" class="l"></span></div></a></div><a href="https://mbasic.facebook.com/feed_preferences/home/" class="bx">Manage Facebook Feed</a></div><div class="bf"><div class="bg" id="annotation-30">30</div><div class="bu bv" style="background-color: #D7C8E2;"><h2 class="o n">Your activity on our Products</h2><div class="bi"><img src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/yD/r/Th6exI59Xpt.png" width="640" height="280" class="l" alt="A cup of coffee, two doughnuts and a hand holding a phone that shows an ad for a bakery."></div><p class="z">For example, William checks in to a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries.</p></div><div class="bu bv" style="background-color: #F9D0CB;"><h2 class="o n">Your activity on third-party websites and apps, depending on your settings</h2><div class="bi"><img src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/yf/r/qlPJB9FCb2w.png" width="640" height="280" class="l" alt="An open shoebox, a new pair of shoes and a hand holding a phone that shows an ad for shoes."></div><p class="z">For example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe shop or in an online chat with a shoe seller.

For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things such as whether it best achieves the advertiser's goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads that we may show you. We use different factors, such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things such as your activity on Meta Products. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/447278887528796" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.</li><li class="y"><strong>All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads.</strong> When you see an ad on Meta Company Products (e.g. in your Facebook Feed), we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show you.</li></ul></div><div class="bf"><div class="bg" id="annotation-89">89</div><h2 class="bh n">IP address</h2><p class="z">Stands for "Internet protocol address".
