Then we can take action to prevent it.</p><h3 class="bt n">Safety and integrity</h3><p class="z">For example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.</p><h3 class="bt n">Performance</h3><p class="z">For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don't have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly.
