<p><em>Effective: February 14, 2025</em></p>
<p>At X.AI LLC (&quot;<strong>xAI</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;), we value your privacy and are committed to being fair, accountable, and transparent in how we handle your personal information. Our Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our websites and applications (the Grok mobile app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/grok/id6670324846">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.x.grok">Android</a>) or the <a href="http://Grok.com">Grok.com</a> website), and other xAI services (our &quot;<strong>Service</strong>&quot;). It also describes your privacy rights.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to data that we process on behalf of customers of our business offerings, such as the xAI API, or to any employment-related personal information processed in consideration of employment with xAI.  This Privacy Policy also does not apply if you access our Service through a third-party’s service.  In that case, the third-party’s privacy policy would apply.  For example, your use of X (previously Twitter), including use of Grok on the X platform, is governed by the <a href="https://x.com/en/privacy">X Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://x.com/en/tos">X Terms</a>, not this xAI Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="4-how-we-may-disclose-personal-information"><strong>4. How we may disclose personal information</strong></h2>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to others. Below, you will find examples and additional information regarding how we may disclose your personal information.</p>
<ul>
<li>To our contracted service providers: To assist in providing the Service to you or performing business operations, we provide your personal information to service providers including providers of hosting, cloud, analytics, content delivery, support and safety monitoring, payment and transaction, and other technology services, for the purposes described above.</li>
<li>In connection with business transfers: In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.

</ul>
<h2 id="5-retention-of-personal-information"><strong>5. Retention of personal information</strong></h2>
<p>We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. In certain circumstances, we will retain your information for legal reasons after our contractual relationship has ended. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement. For example, we may retain your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we have a legal obligation to do so (e.g., if we receive a court order, we would retain your information for longer than our usual retention periods);</li>
<li>To address and resolve requests and complaints (e.g., if there is an ongoing complaint about you);</li>
<li>To protect the safety, security, and integrity of our business and the Service, as well as to protect our rights and property and those of others (e.g., if we detect misuse of our Service or otherwise detect unusual activity on your account or in your interactions with us); and</li>
<li>For litigation, regulatory or other legal matters (e.g., we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim).</li>
</ul>
<p>The length of time we retain data may depend on the features or settings you use.  For example, Grok Temporary Chats will not show in your conversation history and your conversations will be deleted from xAI systems within 30 days unless it is necessary that they be kept longer for legal, compliance, or safety purposes. Further, if you delete any or all of your conversations or if you delete your account, we will delete the data within 30 days unless it is necessary to retain the data for legal, compliance, or safety purposes.</p>
<h2 id="6-marketing"><strong>6. Marketing</strong></h2>
<p>We do not collect and use your personal information for marketing purposes and do not share your personal information with third-parties for the purpose of marketing.</p>
<h2 id="7-security-of-personal-information"><strong>7. Security of personal information</strong></h2>
<p>xAI implements commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures designed to protect personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measure or method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting your log-in and password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites and accounts after your sessions.</p>
<h2 id="8-links-to-other-websites"><strong>8. Links to other websites</strong></h2>
<p>Our Service may contain links to external websites or social media platforms that are not operated by us. Third-party websites and services have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, and you should read these carefully before you submit any personal information to them.</p>
<h2 id="9-children-under-the-age-of-13"><strong>9. Children under the age of 13</strong></h2>
<p>As noted in the <a href="https://x.ai/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, our Service is not directed at children or minors under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from them. While we have taken measures to limit undesirable training data and outputs, Grok could produce output that is not appropriate for all ages.  Parents of teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17 years old must agree to the Terms of Service and are urged to exercise care in monitoring the use of this Service by their teenagers. Depending on how a user interacts with the Service, the Service may have content such as some suggestive dialogue, coarse language, crude humor, sexual situations, or violence.
If you are a child under the age of 13, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use our Service. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a> if you are aware that we may have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13.</p>
<h2 id="10-privacy-rights-and-choices"><strong>10. Privacy rights and choices</strong></h2>
<p>Depending on where you are located and subject to applicable legal exceptions, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal information. For information on the privacy rights that may be available to you under European privacy laws, please review xAI’s <a href="/legal/europe-privacy-policy-addendum">Europe Privacy Policy Addendum</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may have the right to request to access, correct, update or delete your personal information, subject to certain applicable legal exceptions.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Output from our models. If Output contains factually inaccurate personal information relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make reasonable efforts to correct this information — but due to the technical complexity of our models, it may not be feasible for us to do so.</li>
<li>If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
<li>The right to submit certain privacy requests through an Authorized Agent.</li>
<li>The right to be free from discrimination for exercising the rights afforded to you under applicable privacy laws.</li>
<li>The right to appeal a decision we make about your rights request.</li>

<p>Exercising your rights: Some of these rights may be exercised in the xAI Service but for others you will need to submit a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a> and include your full legal name, date of birth, email address, user name, X user handle (if applicable), and physical address.  Once you have submitted your request, we will respond within the time frame permitted by applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that your personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using your information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If an exception applies, we will inform you when responding to your request.</p>
<p>Verification: In order to protect your personal information, your ability to exercise some of the rights detailed in this Privacy Policy may be subject to your ability to verify that you are the person about whom your request pertains. For example, we may require you to verify your identity by validating your account credentials or submitting additional information to allow us to verify your identity.</p>
<p>Authorized Agents: To exercise your rights using an Authorized Agent (as defined under applicable law), you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf. We reserve the right to deny a request from an Authorized Agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>Appeals:  If we refuse to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after receiving your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>.  In such an appeal, you must (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom the original request pertains and to identify the original request, and (2) provide a description of the basis of your appeal.
