<p><em>Last Updated: September 5, 2024 (<a href="/privacy-policy/previous">previous version</a>)</em></p>
<p>At X.AI Corp. (&quot;<strong>xAI</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;), we value your privacy and are committed to being fair, accountable, and transparent in how we handle your personal information. Our Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and use your personal information when you use our websites, products, applications, and other xAI services (our &quot;<strong>Service</strong>&quot;).

If you wish to discontinue such processing or otherwise exercise your rights with respect to such personal information, please contact the company on whose behalf we are processing such data. For example, your use of Grok on X (previously Twitter) is governed by the <a href="https://x.com/en/privacy">X Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://x.com/en/tos">X Terms</a>, not this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>xAI takes reasonable precautions to safeguard your personal information, including through use of appropriate organizational and technical measures to help safeguard your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<p>However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and that any such transmission of your personal information to us is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access to it. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites and online accounts after your sessions.</p>
<p>7. Retention of your personal information</p>
<p>We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (e.g., to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements). In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our contractual relationship has ended. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we keep your personal information when we have a legal obligation to do so (e.g., if we receive a court order, we would retain your data for longer than our usual retention periods);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to deal with and resolve requests and complaints (e.g., if there is an ongoing complaint about you); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to protect individuals&#x27; rights and property and for litigation or regulatory matters (e.g., we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim).</p>
<p>8. Links to other websites and social media features</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Service may contain hyperlinks to websites or plugins of social media platforms that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks and plugins are provided for your reference and convenience only. This Privacy Policy only applies to the personal information that we collect or which we receive as detailed in this Privacy Policy, and we cannot be responsible for personal information about you that is collected and stored by third parties.</p>
<p>Third party websites have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, and you should read these carefully before you submit any personal information to these websites. We do not endorse or otherwise accept any responsibility or liability for the content of such third-party websites or third-party terms and conditions or policies.</p>
<p>9. Children&#x27;s privacy</p>
<p>As noted in the Terms of Use, our Service are not directed at children or minors under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from them. While we have taken measures to limit undesirable training data and outputs, Grok could produce output that is not appropriate for all ages.</p>
<p>If you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use our Service. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information about a child under the age of 18 via our Service, or from any other source, then we will delete that information as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a> if you are aware that we may have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 18.</p>
<p>10. Your rights and choices</p>
<p>Depending on where you are located and subject to applicable legal exceptions, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal information. For more information on the rights that apply under European and US privacy laws, please see Sections 11 and 12 below.</p>
<p>11. Additional information for individuals located in Europe</p>

<p>International transfers</p>
<p>By using our Service, you understand and acknowledge that your personal information will be used, stored and/or accessed by us in the United States and disclosed to our service providers in other jurisdictions. We maintain primary data centers in the United States. We take steps designed to ensure that the personal information we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Policy and according to applicable law.</p>
<p>When we provide any personal information about you to any non-UK and non-EEA third-party, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that there is an adequacy decision by the UK Government in the case of transfers out of the UK, or by the European Commission in the case of transfers out of the EEA, which means that the recipient country is deemed to provide adequate protection for such personal information; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having in place standard contractual clauses with the recipient which have been approved by the UK Government for transfers out of the UK or by European Commission for transfers outside the EEA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal information, in these cases, are available up on request by contacting us by email at privacy@x.ai at any time.</p>
<p>Your rights</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.</p>
<p>Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Output from our models. If Output contain factually inaccurate personal information relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make every effort to correct this information — but due to the technical complexity of our models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information when our processing is based on our legitimate interests, ask us to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information, (i.e., your data to be transferred in a readable and standardized format).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note you can opt-out of our use of your information to train our models by contacting us at privacy@x.ai.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If we send you any marketing communications, you have the right to <strong>opt-out of marketing communications</strong> at any time. We may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your      Grok access or our ongoing business relations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have the right to <strong>complain to a supervisory authority</strong> about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local supervisory authority. Contact details for supervisory authorities in the EEA and the UK are available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">here</a>. Certain supervisory authorities may require that you exhaust our own internal complaints process before looking into your complaint.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an xAI account to access the Service, some of these rights may be exercised through your account. You can also exercise your rights by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>. We will consider all such requests and provide our response in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that your personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using your information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If an exception applies, we will inform you when responding to your request. We may request that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.</p>

<p>Some of the personal information described above may be deemed sensitive personal information under certain state privacy laws. We only collect such information for the purposes allowed by law or with your consent. We do not collect or process sensitive personal information with the purpose of inferring any characteristics about you and have not &quot;sold&quot; or &quot;shared&quot; (as those terms are defined under U.S. privacy laws) personal information. We also do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of individuals under the age of 18.</p>
<p>For more information on how your information is disclosed, please see Section 4 “Sharing of your personal information” above.  As stated in Section 5 “Marketing” above, we do not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>As stated in Section 7 “Retention of your personal information” above, we typically retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>Your rights</p>
<p>In addition to the rights detailed above in Sections 10 and 11 (e.g., your right to access, correct, or update your personal information), depending on what U.S. privacy law applies to you and subject to certain exceptions, you may also have the following rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The right to submit certain privacy requests through an Authorized Agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to request deletion of your personal information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to be free from discrimination for exercising the rights afforded to you under applicable privacy laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to appeal a decision we make about your rights request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exercising your rights</em>: Some of these rights may be exercised in the xAI service but others you will need to submit a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>. Once you have submitted your request, we will respond within the time frame permitted by applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p><em>Verification:</em> In order to protect your personal information, your ability to exercise some of the rights detailed in this Privacy Policy may be subject to your ability to verify that you are the person about whom your request pertains. For example, we may require you to verify your identity by validating your account credentials. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity, we may ask you to supply additional information to allow us to verify your identity.</p>
<p><em>Authorized Agents:</em> To exercise your rights using an Authorized Agent (as defined under applicable law), you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf. We reserve the right to deny a request from an Authorized Agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>
<p><em>Appeals:</em>  If we refuse to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after receiving your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>. In such an appeal, you must (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom the original request pertains and to identify the original request, and (2) provide a description of the basis of your appeal. Please note that your appeal will be subject to your rights and obligations afforded to you under applicable law. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required.</p>
<p><em>Do Not Track:</em> Please note that because the effect of &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals remains unclear, and because there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signal from your browser.</p>
<p>13. Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will post an amended version and change the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date above. Where appropriate, we may provide you with notice prior to the update taking effect, such as by posting a conspicuous notice on our website or by contacting you using the email address you provided. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
<p>If you use the Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all the changes.</p>
<p>14. How to contact us</p>
