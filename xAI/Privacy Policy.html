<p><strong>This Privacy Policy does not apply to data that we process on behalf of our enterprise or business customers, data accessed through our API, which is governed by customer terms.</strong> If you access Grok on a website controlled by one of our customers, the customer&#x27;s privacy policy or other agreement between you and them, and not this Privacy Policy, would apply to such processing. If you wish to discontinue such processing or otherwise exercise your rights with respect to such personal information, please contact the company on whose behalf we are processing such data. For example, your use of X (previously Twitter), including use of Grok on X, is governed by the <a href="https://x.com/en/privacy">X Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://x.com/en/tos">X Terms</a>, not this xAI Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 id="1-about-xai-and-grok">1. About xAI and Grok</h2>
<p>xAI is a US-based company working on building artificial intelligence tools to accelerate human scientific discovery. We are guided by our mission to advance our collective understanding of the universe. xAI is a separate company from X Corp (&quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;, previously Twitter).</p>
<p>For example, we have developed “Grok,” a conversational generative AI powered by xAI’s large language models. Grok’s training journey, and more information about Grok, is available on the <a href="https://x.ai/about">xAI website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-collection-of-your-personal-information">2. Collection of your personal information</h2>

<li><em>Account Data:</em>  When an xAI account is required to access the Service, we will collect your name, contact information, account credentials, and, where payment is required, Payment Data (described below). If you register or log into our Service using another service, that service will send your information to us. For example, when you use your existing X credentials to access the Service on an xAI mobile app or website, X shares the following information with us at your direction: Twitter/X handle/username; your publicly visible name on X; numeric Twitter ID; the URL to your profile picture; and whether you are subscribed to X Premium.</li>

<li><em>User Content:</em> When you use our Service, we collect personal information that is included in user prompts or inputs to the Service (like the text, photos and images, file uploads, and other materials you submit to Grok) (&quot;Input&quot;) and outputs of the Service (like the text responses Grok generates based on your Input) (&quot;Output&quot;) (together, &quot;User Content&quot;).

Please do not share any personal information (including any sensitive information) in your Input to the Service.</li>
<li><em>Feedback Data:</em> Where applicable, we will collect your Feedback (as defined in our Terms of Service). This might arise if, for example, in a given conversation with Grok, you report that Grok returned inaccurate information in an Output or you rate an Output to your Input using the thumbs-up/thumbs-down icons.</li>

</ul>
<p>With the exception of our recruitment activities, we do not aim to collect sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometric data, criminal background, or trade union membership) and ask that you do not provide us with any such information.</p>

<h2 id="4-sharing-of-your-personal-information">4. Sharing of your personal information</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal information with third parties, other than as follows:</p>

For example, we may share information publicly to show trends in the use of our Service.</p>
<p>Save as expressly detailed above, we do not share, sell, or rent any of your personal information to any third party and will not do so without updating this Privacy Policy, notifying you, or, where necessary, obtaining your consent.</p>

<p>We do not collect and use your personal information for marketing purposes and do not share your personal information with third parties for the purpose of marketing.</p>
<h2 id="6-security-of-your-personal-information">6. Security of your personal information</h2>
<p>xAI takes reasonable precautions to safeguard your personal information, including through use of appropriate organizational and technical measures to help safeguard your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<p>However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and that any such transmission of your personal information to us is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access to it. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites and online accounts after your sessions.</p>
<h2 id="7-retention-of-your-personal-information">7. Retention of your personal information</h2>
<p>We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (e.g., to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements). In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our contractual relationship has ended. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement.</p>
<p>For example, we may retain your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when we have a legal obligation to do so (e.g., if we receive a court order, we would retain your information for longer than our usual retention periods);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to deal with and resolve requests and complaints (e.g., if there is an ongoing complaint about you);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our business and the Service, as well as to protect our rights and property and those of others (e.g., if we detect misuse of our Service or otherwise detect unusual activity on your account or in your interactions with us); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for litigation or regulatory matters (e.g., we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>International transfers</p>
<p>By using our Service, you understand and acknowledge that your personal information will be used, stored and/or accessed by us in the United States and disclosed to our service providers in other jurisdictions. We maintain primary data centers in the United States. We take steps designed to ensure that the personal information we collect under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Policy and according to applicable law.</p>
<p>When we provide any personal information about you to any non-UK and non-EEA third-party, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that there is an adequacy decision by the UK Government in the case of transfers out of the UK, or by the European Commission in the case of transfers out of the EEA, which means that the recipient country is deemed to provide adequate protection for such personal information; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having in place standard contractual clauses with the recipient which have been approved by the UK Government for transfers out of the UK or by European Commission for transfers outside the EEA.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal information, in these cases, are available up on request by contacting us by email at privacy@x.ai at any time.</p>
<p>Your rights</p>
<ul>
<li>You may <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.<br/>
<!-- -->Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Output from our models. If Output contains factually inaccurate personal information relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make every effort to correct this information — but due to the technical complexity of our models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.</li>
<li>You can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information when our processing is based on our legitimate interests, ask us to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information, (i.e., your data to be transferred in a readable and standardized format).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note you can opt-out of our use of your information to train our models by contacting us at privacy@x.ai.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we send you any marketing communications, you have the right to <strong>opt-out of marketing communications</strong> at any time. We may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your      Grok access, legally required notices, or our ongoing business relations.</li>
<li>If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
<li>You have the right to <strong>complain to a supervisory authority</strong> about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local supervisory authority. Contact details for supervisory authorities in the EEA and the UK are available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">here</a>. Certain supervisory authorities may require that you exhaust our own internal complaints process before looking into your complaint.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an xAI account to access the Service, some of these rights may be exercised through your account. You can also exercise your rights by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>. We will consider all such requests and provide our response in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that your personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using your information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If an exception applies, we will inform you when responding to your request. We may request that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.</p>

<p>Some of the personal information described above may be deemed sensitive personal information under certain state privacy laws. We only collect such information for the purposes allowed by law or with your consent. We do not collect or process sensitive personal information with the purpose of inferring any characteristics about you and have not &quot;sold&quot; or &quot;shared&quot; (as those terms are defined under U.S. privacy laws) personal information. We also do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of individuals under the age of 13.</p>
<p>For more information on how your information is disclosed, please see Section 4 “Sharing of your personal information” above.  As stated in Section 5 “Marketing” above, we do not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>

We collect and use personal information for the business or commercial purposes described in Section 3 “How we use your personal information (our purposes)” above.</p>
<p>Your rights</p>
<p>In addition to the rights detailed above in Sections 10 and 11 (e.g., your right to access, correct, or update your personal information), depending on what U.S. privacy law applies to you and subject to certain exceptions, you may also have the following rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to submit certain privacy requests through an Authorized Agent.</li>
<li>The right to request deletion of your personal information.</li>
<li>The right to be free from discrimination for exercising the rights afforded to you under applicable privacy laws.</li>
<li>The right to appeal a decision we make about your rights request.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exercising your rights</em>: Some of these rights may be exercised in the xAI service but others you will need to submit a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>. Once you have submitted your request, we will respond within the time frame permitted by applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p><em>Verification:</em> In order to protect your personal information, your ability to exercise some of the rights detailed in this Privacy Policy may be subject to your ability to verify that you are the person about whom your request pertains. For example, we may require you to verify your identity by validating your account credentials. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity, we may ask you to supply additional information to allow us to verify your identity.</p>
<p><em>Authorized Agents:</em> To exercise your rights using an Authorized Agent (as defined under applicable law), you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf. We reserve the right to deny a request from an Authorized Agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>
<p><em>Appeals:</em>  If we refuse to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after receiving your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>. In such an appeal, you must (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom the original request pertains and to identify the original request, and (2) provide a description of the basis of your appeal. Please note that your appeal will be subject to your rights and obligations afforded to you under applicable law. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required.</p>
<p><em>Do Not Track:</em> Please note that because the effect of &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals remains unclear, and because there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signal from your browser.</p>
<h2 id="13-changes-to-this-privacy-policy">13. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will post an amended version and change the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date above. Where appropriate, we may provide you with notice prior to the update taking effect, such as by posting a conspicuous notice on our website or by contacting you using the email address you provided. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
<p>If you use the Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all the changes.</p>
