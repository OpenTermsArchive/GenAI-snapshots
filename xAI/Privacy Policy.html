<p><em>Effective: January 2, 2024 (<a href="/legal/privacy-policy/previous-2024-12-20">previous version</a>)</em></p>
<p>At x.AI, L.L.C. (&quot;<strong>xAI</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;), we value your privacy and are committed to being fair, accountable, and transparent in how we handle your personal information. Our Privacy Policy outlines how we collect and use your personal information when you use our websites, applications, and other xAI services (our &quot;<strong>Service</strong>&quot;). It also describes your privacy rights.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to data that we process on behalf of customers of our business offerings, such as our API.  Our use of that data is governed by customer agreements covering access to and use of those business offerings.  This Privacy Policy also does not apply if you access our Service through a third-party’s service.  In that case, the third-party’s privacy policy would apply, and you would contact that third-party regarding the processing of your personal information.  For example, your use of X (previously Twitter), including use of Grok on X, is governed by the <a href="https://x.com/en/privacy">X Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://x.com/en/tos">X Terms</a>, not this xAI Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2 id="1-about-xai-and-grok"><strong>1. About xAI and Grok</strong></h2>
<p>xAI is a US-based company working on building artificial intelligence tools to accelerate human scientific discovery. We are guided by our mission to advance our collective understanding of the universe.  As part of our mission, we have developed “Grok,” a conversational generative AI powered by xAI’s large language models. More information about xAI’s development and training of Grok, is available on the <a href="https://x.ai/about">xAI website</a>.  xAI is a separate company from X Corp (&quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;, previously Twitter).</p>
<h2 id="2-personal-information-we-collect"><strong>2. Personal information we collect</strong></h2>

If you log into our Service using a third-party service, that third-party will send your information to us at your direction. For example, if you use your existing X credentials to log into an xAI mobile app or website, you may choose to direct X to share the following information with us: your X public profile, X username; numeric X ID; whether you are subscribed to X Premium, and your Grok on X conversation history.</li>

If you include personal information in Inputs you provide to the Service, this information may be reproduced in the Output. Please do not share any personal information (including any sensitive information) in your Input to the Service.</li>

<p>With the exception of our recruitment activities, we do not aim to collect sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometric data, criminal background, or trade union membership) and ask that you do not provide us with any such information.</p>

<p>xAI implements commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures designed to protect personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measure or method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you provide to the Services. In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting access to your devices, and signing out of websites and accounts after your sessions.</p>
<h2 id="7-retention-of-your-personal-information"><strong>7. Retention of your personal information</strong></h2>
<p>We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. In certain circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons after our contractual relationship has ended. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement. For example, we may retain your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>when we have a legal obligation to do so (e.g., if we receive a court order, we would retain your information for longer than our usual retention periods);</li>
<li>to deal with and resolve requests and complaints (e.g., if there is an ongoing complaint about you);</li>
<li>to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our business and the Service, as well as to protect our rights and property and those of others (e.g., if we detect misuse of our Service or otherwise detect unusual activity on your account or in your interactions with us); and</li>
<li>for litigation or regulatory matters (e.g., we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim).</li>
</ul>
<p>The length of time we retain data may depend on the features or settings you use.  For example, Grok Temporary Chats will not show in your conversation history but will be kept in xAI’s systems for up to 30 days for safety purposes.</p>

<h3 id="122-your-rights"><strong>12.2 Your rights</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to the rights detailed above in Sections 10 and 11 (e.g., your right to access, correct, or update your personal information), depending on what U.S. privacy law applies to you and subject to certain exceptions, you may also have the following rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to submit certain privacy requests through an Authorized Agent.</li>
<li>The right to request deletion of your personal information.</li>
<li>The right to be free from discrimination for exercising the rights afforded to you under applicable privacy laws.</li>
<li>The right to appeal a decision we make about your rights request.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exercising your rights</em>: Some of these rights may be exercised in the xAI service but others you will need to submit a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>. Once you have submitted your request, we will respond within the time frame permitted by applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p><em>Verification:</em> In order to protect your personal information, your ability to exercise some of the rights detailed in this Privacy Policy may be subject to your ability to verify that you are the person about whom your request pertains. For example, we may require you to verify your identity by validating your account credentials. If we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity, we may ask you to supply additional information to allow us to verify your identity.</p>
<p><em>Authorized Agents:</em> To exercise your rights using an Authorized Agent (as defined under applicable law), you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf. We reserve the right to deny a request from an Authorized Agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>
<p><em>Appeals:</em>  If we refuse to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after receiving your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@x.ai">privacy@x.ai</a>. In such an appeal, you must (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom the original request pertains and to identify the original request, and (2) provide a description of the basis of your appeal. Please note that your appeal will be subject to your rights and obligations afforded to you under applicable law. We respond to all appeal requests as soon as we reasonably can, and no later than legally required.</p>
<p><em>Do Not Track:</em> Please note that because the effect of &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signals remains unclear, and because there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signal from your browser.</p>
<h2 id="13-changes-to-this-privacy-policy"><strong>13. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
