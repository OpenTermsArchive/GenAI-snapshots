<p><em>Last Updated: 15 March 2024</em></p>
<p>At X.AI Corp. (&quot;<strong>xAI</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;), we value
your privacy and are committed to being fair, accountable, and
transparent in how we handle your personal information. Our Privacy
Policy outlines how we collect and use your personal information, when
you use our websites, products (like Grok) and other xAI services (our
&quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot;). It also describes your privacy rights.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information we process
for and on behalf of our customers, like X Corp. (&quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;, previously
Twitter). In that case, the enterprise customer&#x27;s privacy policy or
other agreement between you and them, and not this Privacy Policy, would
apply to such processing. If you wish to discontinue such processing or
otherwise exercise your rights with respect to such personal
information, please contact the enterprise on whose behalf we are
processing such data. For example, your use of Grok on X is governed by
the <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy"><u>X Privacy Policy</u></a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/en/tos"><u>Terms</u></a>, not this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Quick links</p>
<p>We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full to ensure you are
completely informed about the processing of your personal information.

<h2>1. About xAI and Grok</h2>
<p>xAI is a US-based company working on building artificial intelligence
tools to accelerate human scientific discovery. We are guided by our
mission to advance our collective understanding of the universe. xAI is
a separate company from X Corp (&quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;, previously Twitter).</p>
<p>We have developed a conversational generative AI chatbot powered by
Grok, a large language model (&quot;<strong>LLM</strong>&quot;) that performs natural language
processing tasks, including question answering, information retrieval,
creative writing, and coding assistance. Grok’s training journey, and
more information for access to Grok, is available on the <a href="https://x.ai/"><u>xAI
website</u></a> and <a href="https://x.ai/model-card/"><u>Model
Card</u></a>.</p>
<h2>2. Collection of your personal information</h2>
<h3>2.1 Personal information you provide</h3>
<p>When you use our Services or communicate with us, you provide certain
personal information. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><u>Registration Data</u>:</em>  When you use your existing X
credentials to access Grok on the xAI website, X shares the
following information with us at your direction: Twitter/X
handle/username; your publicly visible name on X; numeric Twitter
ID; the URL to your profile picture; and whether you are subscribed
to X Premium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>Payment Data</u>:</em> We may collect payment information directly
from you and details regarding your transactions with us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>Contact and Communications Data</u>:</em> If you communicate with
us, we will collect contact information such as your name, email
address, any other contact details you voluntarily choose to provide
us, and any additional information you provide in your
communications with us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>Prompt Data (or search queries) and Output Data</u></em>: Grok
allows you to submit search queries in free text format
(&quot;<strong>Prompts</strong>&quot;), which will generate text responses based on your
Prompts (&quot;<strong>Outputs</strong>&quot;) (together, &quot;<strong>Conversation Data</strong>&quot;). If you
include personal information in your Prompts, this information may
be reproduced in the Outputs. Please do not share any personal
information (including any sensitive information) in your questions
to Grok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>Feedback Data</u></em>: Where applicable, we will collect your
Feedback (as defined in our <a href="https://x.ai/legal/terms-of-service/"><u>Terms of
Use</u></a>). This might arise
if, for example, in a given conversation with Grok you report that
Grok returned inaccurate information in an Output, or if you rate an
Output to your Prompt using the thumbs-up/ thumbs-down icons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>Applicant Data</u></em>: If you apply for a job with xAI, we will
collect your personal information such as your contact details,
resume/CV, education and work history, and visa status. You also may
choose to provide your gender, ethnicity, veteran status, disability
status, and links to your website, blog, portfolio, LinkedIn or
other public profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>Social Media Information</u></em>: We have pages on social media
sites like Instagram, Facebook, Medium, X, YouTube and LinkedIn.
When you interact with our social media pages, we collect personal
information that you choose to provide to us, such as your contact
details (collectively, “<strong>Social Data</strong>”). In addition, the
companies that host our social media pages may provide us with
aggregate information and analytics about our social media activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of our recruitment activities, we do not aim to
collect sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to
racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs,
health, biometric data, criminal background, or trade union membership)
and ask that you do not provide us with any such information.</p>
<h3>2.2 Personal information we collect automatically</h3>
<p>We automatically collect certain device and usage information when you
use or interact with our Services (collectively, &quot;<strong>Technical Usage
Data</strong>&quot;). This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><u>Device data</u>:</em> Technical information such as your IP address,
device type, country from which you access, browser type and
version, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>Usage data</u></em>: Information about your use such as links you
click, pages you view, date and time of your visit, duration of
visits, pages visited, browsing history, search history, traffic
data, standard server log information, and other communication data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>Inferred location data</u></em>: your country-level location based
on the IP address.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may collect this information through our Services or through other
methods of web analysis, including with the help of technologies, such
as cookies, web beacons, and clear gifs.</p>
<p>2.3 Personal information from other sources</p>
<p>The personal information we obtain from other sources includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Publicly available data</u></em>: Like most LLM&#x27;s today, Grok has
been pre-trained on a variety of data from publicly available
sources (i.e., open-source public data sets) which mainly consist of
raw web page data, metadata extracts, and text extracts from the
Internet up to Q3 2023. We only use publicly available information
that is freely and openly available on the Internet. xAI does not
access password protected pages or bypass CAPTCHA controls, nor seek
personal information behind paywalls or from the dark web. In some
instances, this pre-training data may incidentally include personal
information (for example, information about politicians,
celebrities, published authors or other public figures) and
sensitive information (for example, political opinions, religious or
philosophical beliefs, or information concerning sexual orientation,
among others). We take steps to minimize the processing of personal
and sensitive data for our training purposes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For clarity, xAI does not actively seek out personal information to
train our models and we do not use any personal information to build
individual profiles, to contact or advertise to individuals, to try to
sell them anything, or to sell the personal information itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Public X posts and Internet search data</u></em>: In responding to
search queries, Grok has a feature that allows it to search public X
posts and conduct a real-time web search of public results from the
Internet. Grok’s access to real-time data allows Grok to respond to
search queries with up-to-date information and insights on a wide
range of topics. In some instances, this data may include personal
information.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we may receive personal information about you from our
affiliated companies and third parties, such as recruitment agencies and
social media platforms. This information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mailing addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers,
intent data (or user behavior data), IP addresses, social media
profiles, LinkedIn URLs, and custom profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resumes and background check information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. How we use your personal information (our purposes)</p>
<p>We use your personal information for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<p><em><u>To process payment for our Services</u></em>: in relation to access to
certain features of our Services, as applicable.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><u>To provide our Services (including to provide Outputs in
response to Prompts)</u></em>: We use your personal information to
operate and provide our Services and to tailor our Services to your
needs and preferences to perform our contract with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>To provide support and assistance in relation to our Services,
including to communicate with you and respond to your
enquiries</u></em>: We use your personal information to troubleshoot and
diagnose problems, provide customer care and support services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>To maintain and improve our Services</u></em>: We use your personal
information for research and development purposes, to analyze trends
to identify future opportunities for the development, promotion, and
improvement of our Services. For example, we use data, often in a
de-identified form, to develop new features, capabilities, or
products, improve the user experience, assess capability
requirements, and identify customer opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>To train and fine-tune our LLM</u></em>: xAI will process (i)
publicly available data, public X posts and Internet search data
(see Section 2.3 above), and (ii) a subset of Conversation Data and
Feedback Data you voluntarily choose to provide to us, for training
and fine-tuning purposes (e.g., to improve the accuracy of
responses, the style of the responses, detect errors, etc.). This
means that when you interact with Grok, your questions and responses
provided by Grok may be used to train the LLM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>To ensure the security and integrity of our Services</u></em>: We do
this by preventing and detecting fraud, unauthorized use, and other
unlawful use of our Services by verifying activity, investigating
suspicious activity, and enforcing our terms and policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>To comply with our legal obligations</u></em>: We process your
personal information when cooperating with public and government
authorities, courts or regulators in accordance with our legal
obligations under applicable laws, to the extent this requires the
processing or disclosure of personal information to protect our
rights, or is necessary for protecting against misuse or abuse of
our Services, protecting personal property or safety, pursuing
remedies available to us and limiting our damages, complying with
judicial proceedings, court orders or legal processes, or to respond
to lawful requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>To process job applications</u></em>: We process your personal
information if you apply for a job with xAI, to evaluate your
application and make hiring decisions, communicate with you and
inform you of current and future career opportunities (unless you
tell us that you do not want us to keep your details for such
purposes), manage and improve our recruiting and hiring processes,
or to conduct reference and background checks where required or
permitted by applicable local law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>For our business or commercial purpose</u></em>: We may use your
personal information for other legitimate business purposes, such as
to identify new customers, data analysis, developing new products,
identifying usage trends, and operating and expanding our business
activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from
different contexts or that we obtain from third parties to give you a
more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed
business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information for reasons not described in this
Privacy Policy were permitted by law and the reason is compatible with
the purpose for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal
information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the
applicable legal basis.</p>
<h3>4. Sharing of your personal information</h3>

as follows:</p>

consultants</u>:</em> To assist in providing the Services to you or
performing business operations, we provide your personal information

others, for the purposes described above.</p>

<li>
<p><em><u>In connection with business transfers</u>:</em> In connection with
or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition,
bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale,
transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our
business or assets to another company. If required by applicable
laws, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any transfer
of personal information to an unaffiliated third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>To comply with our <em>legal obligations</em></u><em>:</em> To (i) comply with
laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii)
protect the rights and property of xAI and our agents, customers,

of use, or (iii) in an emergency, to protect the personal safety of
xAI, its customers, or any person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><u>With our related companies</u></em>: We may disclose personal
information to our related companies to the extent such sharing is
necessary to fulfil a request you have submitted via our Services or
for customer management, customer support, technical operations, or
the purposes described above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also share anonymized, aggregated and de-identified usage data
with our related companies and also with third parties to help us
perform analysis and make improvements. Additionally, we may share
anonymous usage data on an aggregate basis in the normal course of
operating our business. For example, we may share information publicly
to show trends in the use of our Services.</p>
<p>Save as expressly detailed above, we do not share, sell, or rent any of
your personal information to any third party and will not do so without
updating this Privacy Policy, notifying you, or, where necessary,
obtaining your consent.</p>
<p>Please note that any personal information or other information you
choose to submit in communities, forums, blogs, or chat rooms on our
websites may be read, collected, and used by others who visit these
forums or pages.</p>
<h3>5. Marketing</h3>
<p>We do not collect and use your personal information for marketing
purposes and do not share your personal information with third parties
for the purpose of marketing.</p>
<h3>6. Security of your personal information</h3>
<p>xAI takes reasonable precautions to safeguard your personal information,
including through use of appropriate organizational and technical
measures to help safeguard your personal information against accidental
or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<p>However, no security measure or modality of data transmission over the
Internet is 100% secure. Although we strive to use commercially
acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot
guarantee absolute security. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we
cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and that any
such transmission of your personal information to us is at your own
risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use
strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access
to it. You are solely responsible for protecting your password, limiting
access to your devices, and signing out of websites and online accounts
after your sessions.</p>
<h3>7. Retention of your personal information</h3>
<p>We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate
business need to do so (e.g., to provide you with a service you have
requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements). In certain
circumstances, we will need to keep your information for legal reasons
after our contractual relationship has ended. The specific retention
periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected
and processed and the nature of the legal requirement.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we keep your personal information when we have a legal obligation to
do so (e.g., if we receive a court order, we would retain your data
for longer than our usual retention periods);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to deal with and resolve requests and complaints (e.g., if there is
an ongoing complaint about you); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to protect individuals&#x27; rights and property and for litigation or
regulatory matters (e.g., we would retain your information if there
was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the
claim).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Links to other websites and social media features</h3>
<p>Our Services may contain hyperlinks to websites or plugins of social
media platforms that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks and
plugins are provided for your reference and convenience only. This
Privacy Policy only applies to the personal information that we collect
or which we receive as detailed in this Privacy Policy, and we cannot be
responsible for personal information about you that is collected and
stored by third parties.</p>
<p>Third party websites have their own terms and conditions and privacy
policies, and you should read these carefully before you submit any
personal information to these websites. We do not endorse or otherwise
accept any responsibility or liability for the content of such
third-party websites or third-party terms and conditions or policies.</p>
<h3>9. Children&#x27;s privacy</h3>
<p>As noted in the Terms of Use, our Services are not directed at children
or minors under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect any
personal information from them. While we have taken measures to limit
undesirable training data and outputs, Grok could produce output that is
not appropriate for all ages.</p>
<p>If you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to
register for or otherwise use our Services. If we learn that we have
inadvertently obtained personal information about a child under the age
of 18 via our Services, or from any other source, then we will delete
that information as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84f4f6edf2e5e7fdc4fcaae5ed"><u><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9eeeecf7e8fffde7dee6b0fff7">[email&#160;protected]</span></u></a> if you
are aware that we may have inadvertently collected personal information
from a child under the age of 18.</p>
<p>10. Your rights and choices</p>
<p>Depending on where you are located and subject to applicable legal
exceptions, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal
information. For more information on the rights that apply under
European and US privacy laws, please see Sections 11 and 12 below.</p>

<p>With the exception of our recruitment activities, we do not aim to
collect sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to
racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs,
health, biometric data, criminal background, or trade union membership)
and ask that you do not provide us with any such information.</p>
<u>Automated decision-making and profiling</u>
<p>Grok does not derive predictions or inferences about individuals. xAI is
not creating any profiles on individuals, and it does not make decisions
or take actions against data subjects in ways that could have a legal or
significant impact on them.</p>
<p>In addition, in relation to Grok&#x27;s training, xAI is not processing the
training data for the purposes of inferring or deriving any personal
information, including any special category data and xAI has not
actively sought out data sources that include sensitive data. Moreover,
xAI has implemented and will continue to implement measures to minimize
and eliminate any personal information processing for training purposes.</p>
<u>International transfers</u>
<p>By using our Services, you understand and acknowledge that your personal
information will be used, stored and/or accessed by us (an entity based
in the United States) and disclosed to our service providers in other
jurisdictions. We maintain primary data centers in the United States. We
take steps designed to ensure that the personal information we collect
under this Privacy Policy is processed as described in this Policy and
according to applicable law wherever the data subjects are located.</p>
<p>When we provide any personal information about you to any non-UK and
non-EEA third-party, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that
the recipient protects your personal information adequately in
accordance with this Privacy Policy. These measures may include the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that there is an adequacy decision by the UK Government in
the case of transfers out of the UK, or by the European Commission
in the case of transfers out of the EEA, which means that the
recipient country is deemed to provide adequate protection for such
personal information including reliance on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy
Framework (&quot;<strong>EU-U.S. DPF</strong>&quot;) and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S.
DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having in place standard contractual clauses with the recipient
which have been approved by the European Commission for transfers
outside the EEA or the UK Government for transfers out of the UK.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal
information, in these cases, are available up on request by contacting
us by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b9c9cbd0cfd8dac0f9c197d8d0">[email&#160;protected]</a> at any time.</p>
<u>Your rights</u>
<ul>
<li>You may <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your
personal information, subject to certain exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Outputs.
If Outputs contain factually inaccurate personal information relating
to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make every
effort to correct this information —but due to the technical
complexity of our LLM, it may not always be possible for us to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information, ask
us to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information or
<strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information, (i.e., your
data to be transferred in a readable and standardized format).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we send you any marketing communications, you have the right to
<strong>opt-out of marketing communications</strong> at any time. We may still
send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your Grok
access or our ongoing business relations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we have collected and processed your personal information with
your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect
processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have the right to <strong>complain to a supervisory authority</strong> about
our collection and use of your personal information. For more
information, please contact your local supervisory authority.
Contact details for supervisory authorities in the EEA and the UK
are available
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm"><u>here</u></a>.
Certain supervisory authorities may require that you exhaust our own
internal complaints process before looking into your complaint.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can exercise your rights by contacting us
at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#09797b607f686a704971276860"><u><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4737352e3126243e073f69262e">[email&#160;protected]</span></u></a>. We will consider all such
requests and provide our response in accordance with applicable data
protection laws.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that certain personal information may be exempt
from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to
keep using the information to comply with our own legal obligations or
to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If an exception applies,
we will inform you when responding to your request. We may request you
provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before
responding to any request you make.</p>

<p>We do not collect or process sensitive personal information with the
purpose of inferring any characteristics about you and have not &quot;sold&quot;
or &quot;shared&quot; (as those terms are defined under U.S. privacy laws)
personal information.</p>
<u>Your rights</u>
<p>In addition to the rights detailed above in Sections 10 and 11,
depending on what U.S. privacy law applies to you and subject to certain
exceptions, you may also have the following rights :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The right to submit certain privacy requests through and Authorized
Agents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to request deletion of your personal information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right to be free from discrimination for exercising the rights
afforded to you under applicable privacy laws</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exercising your rights</em>: Some of these rights may be exercised in the
xAI service but others you will need to submit a request
to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6b1b19021d0a08122b13450a02"><u><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7707051e0116140e370f59161e">[email&#160;protected]</span></u></a>.</p>
<p><em>Verification:</em> In order to protect your personal information, your
ability to exercise some of the rights detailed in this Privacy Policy
may be subject to your ability to verify that you are the person about
whom your request pertains. For example, we may require you to verify
your identity by validating your X account credentials. If we suspect
fraudulent or malicious activity, we may ask you to supply additional
information to allow us to verify your identity.</p>
<p><em>Authorized Agents:</em> To exercise your rights using an Authorized Agent
(as defined under applicable law). To do this, you must provide your
Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your
behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your
Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p>
<p><em>Appeals:</em> The right to appeal a decision we make. If we refuse to take
action on a request within a reasonable period of time after receiving
your request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us
at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91e1e3f8e7f0f2e8d1e9bff0f8"><u><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="304042594651534970481e5159">[email&#160;protected]</span></u></a>. In such an appeal, you
must (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you
are the person about whom the original request pertains and to identify
the original request, and (2) provide a description of the basis of your
appeal. Please note that your appeal will be subject to your rights and
obligations afforded to you under applicable law.</p>
<p><em>Do Not Track:</em> Please note that because the effect of &quot;Do Not Track&quot;
signals remains unclear, and there continues to be no consistent
industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not
alter our privacy practices when we detect a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; signal from
your browser.</p>
<h3>13. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any
changes, we will post an amended version and change the &quot;Last Updated&quot;
date above. Where appropriate, we may provide you with notice prior to
the update taking effect, such as by posting a conspicuous notice on our
website or by contacting you using the email address you provided.
Please review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
<p>If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have
been posted, that means you agree to all the changes.</p>
