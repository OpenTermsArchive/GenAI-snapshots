<h2 id="content"><strong>Content</strong></h2>
<p><strong>You own your Content.</strong> You may provide input to the Service (”Input”) and receive output from the Service based on the Input (”Output”). Collectively, Input and Output are “Content.” You are responsible for Content, including ensuring that it does not violate any applicable law or these Terms.

<p><strong>Our use of Content.</strong> You grant, an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, and worldwide right to xAI to use, copy, store, modify, distribute, reproduce, publish, list information regarding, make derivative works of, aggregate, and display your Content: (i) to maintain and provide the Service; (ii) to improve our products and the Service and for our other business purposes, such as data analysis, customer and market research, developing new products or features, and identifying usage trends; and (iii) to perform such other actions to enforce these Terms, comply with our Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, keep our Service safe, or as authorized by you in connection with your use of the Service.<br/>

<!-- -->Private Chat and Content that you request to be deleted is maintained on our backend systems for up to 30 days before deletion.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy.</strong> Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and is probabilistic in nature; it may therefore sometimes result in Output that contains “hallucinations,” may be offensive, may not accurately reflect real people, places or facts, may be objectionable, inappropriate, or otherwise not be suitable for your intended purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Similarity of content.</strong> Due to the nature of artificial intelligence, outputs may not be unique and users may receive similar output from our Service. Your rights to Output does not extend to other’s rights.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to third-party services.</strong> Certain features of the Service may facilitate your ability to connect to a third-party service, such as X. If you choose to send your Content to such a third-party service, you are instructing and authorizing xAI to send your Content out of the Service. Please review the policies of any third-party service providers for additional information about how they may use those materials.</p>
<p><strong>Electing whether your Content is used for training.</strong> When logged into our Service, you can select whether or not you want us to use your Content to train our models and improve our services. Where available, you may access our Service without logging in. When doing so, where permitted, you grant us the rights to use any data you provide to or obtain from our Service for model training purposes. Further details are available in the Privacy Policy and Consumer FAQs.</p>

<h2 id="dispute-resolution"><strong>Dispute resolution</strong></h2>
<p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER THAT YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM XAI.<br/>
<!-- -->You and xAI agree to the following mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions:</p>
<p><strong>MANDATORY ARBITRATION.</strong> You and xAI agree to resolve any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Service, regardless of when the claim arose, even if it was before these Terms existed (a “Claim”), through final and binding arbitration (this “Arbitration Agreement”). You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of account creation or of any updates to these Terms within 30 days after the update has taken effect by emailing us at <a href="mailto:legal@x.ai">legal@x.ai</a> with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of an update, the last set of agreed upon Terms will apply. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.</p>
<p><strong>Dispute-Resolution Process.</strong> For any Claim, you will first contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@x.ai">legal@x.ai</a> and meet and confer to attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein. AAA may be contacted at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference, unless the Arbitrator determines it must be in person, in which case it will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live (if applicable) or Palo Alto, California, unless you and xAI agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are, or whether any provision of these Terms is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions.</strong> This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.</p>
<p>CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND XAI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO ALL USERS (BOTH NATURAL PERSONS AND ENTITIES), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. YOU AND XAI AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</p>
<h2 id="general-provisions"><strong>General Provisions</strong></h2>
<p>**Assignment. **These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior express written consent, but may be assigned by us without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof will be null and void.</p>
<p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of<br/>

<p>**Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms. **We may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by applicable law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice or written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on the Service, as we determine, at our sole discretion. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will update the ‘Effective’ date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any change to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any part of these Terms or to any future Terms of Service, do not access or use (or continue to access or use) the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement; Severability.</strong> These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional written agreements you may enter into with us in connection with the Service, will constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Service. Any statements or comments made between you and any of our employees or representatives are expressly excluded from these Terms and will not apply to you or us, or to your access to or use of the Service. Except as otherwise stated in the Arbitration Agreement, if any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><strong>No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or of any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p><strong>Definition of Consumer.</strong> For the purposes of these Europe Specific Terms &quot;European Consumers&quot; are individuals with a habitual place of residence in the EEA, UK or Switzerland acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual’s trade, business, craft or profession.</p>
<p><strong>Order process.</strong> The order process allows you to check and amend any errors before submitting your registration.

<p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of laws principles. If you are an European-Consumer, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident.</p>
<p><strong>Venue of jurisdiction.</strong> The Section titled “Dispute Resolution” does not apply if you are a European-Consumer. As a European-Consumer, you may bring any dispute which may arise under these Terms or in connection with the use of the Service, at your discretion, in the applicable courts of the country in which you are habitually resident.

For this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; in no case will you be charged any fees because of this repayment. Please note this does not include an X Premium or X Premium+ account charges because that is not part of this Service. Please refer to the X Premium Terms of Use for further details of how to claim a refund for those charges.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions to the right of withdrawal.</strong><br/>
<!-- -->The right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts:</p>
<ol>
<li>for events which have been put together individually at your request and which are adapted to your personal need,</li>
<li>which we conclude with anyone or any entity other than a European Consumer,</li>
<li>which are not concluded exclusively using means of distance communication (e.g., e-mail, post).</li>
</ol>
<p>**Model Withdrawal Form. **(If you wish to withdraw from the contract, you can fill in this form and return it to us.)</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> For European Consumers resident in the UK, the “Limitation of Liability” section above shall not apply and shall be replaced with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits xAI’s liability for (1) death or personal injury caused by xAI’s negligence, (2) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or (3) any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict our liability.</li>
<li>If xAI fails to comply with these Terms, xAI is responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of xAI’s breach of these Terms or xAI’s negligence, but xAI is not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of xAI’s breach or if it was contemplated by you and xAI at the time that these Terms between you and xAI became binding.</li>
<li>xAI only supplies the Service under these Terms for domestic and private use. You agree not to use the Service for any commercial or business purposes and xAI has no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</li>
</ol>
<p>For European Consumers outside of the UK, the limitation of liability provided for in Section 13 does not apply. Instead, the following limitation of liability applies: xAI&#x27;s liability to you for damages caused by mere negligence, irrespective of its legal ground, shall be limited as follows: (a) for any breach of a material contractual obligation, xAI will be liable up to the amount of foreseeable damages typically occurring for this type of contract; and (b) for a breach of any non-material contractual obligations nor for the merely negligent breach of any other applicable duty of care xAI will not be liable. The aforementioned limitations of liability, as well as any other limitations of liability contained in these Terms, will not apply to any mandatory statutory obligation, in particular to statutory obligation under applicable product liability laws, and any liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence. Additionally, such limitations of liability will not apply if and to the extent that xAI has made a specific guarantee. The foregoing exclusions and limitations of liability shall also apply to the same extent in favor of xAI&#x27;s executive bodies, legal representatives, employees and vicarious agents.</p>
<p><strong>Information regarding Warranty and Compatibility/interoperability.</strong> The Limitation of Liabilities Section is not applicable to European-Consumers. The Service, as a digital product, is subject to a statutory warranty for defects. xAI will inform and supply you with updates that are necessary to keep the Service in conformity during the relevant contractual term.</p>
<p><strong>No Release; Indemnity.</strong> The Release Section and Indemnity Section of the Terms shall not be applicable to European-Consumers subject to these Europe Specific Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Terms and the Europe Specific Terms.</strong> Contrary to the above Procedures and Changes to these Terms Section above, with respect to European-Consumers, xAI may unilaterally make changes to these Terms (including the Europe Specific Terms) only when it is necessary to do so, particularly as a result of changes of law or to ensure a better functionality of the Service. xAI shall take proportionate measures to notify Users of such changes to the Terms and when the changes will take effect on our websites and in our Apps. xAI will provide this notice at least 14 calendar days prior to the date on which the changes will take effect. However, if the change is particularly significant, xAI shall notify you of the changes at least one month in advance. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you may object and must discontinue your use of the Service. If you do not object and continue to use the Service, you will be deemed to have acknowledged the amendment and agreed to be bound by it.</p>
<p><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> The “Entire Agreement” Section above shall not apply to European-Consumers, save that the final sentence of that Section shall apply in relation to severability.</p>
