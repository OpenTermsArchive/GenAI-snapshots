<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>General.</strong> To use any App, you must have a mobile device that
is compatible with such App. xAI does not warrant that any App
will be compatible with your mobile device. You may use mobile
data in connection with an App and may incur additional charges
from your wireless provider in connection with such App. You
understand and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for
any such charges. We hereby grant you a non-exclusive, limited,
non-transferable, and freely revocable license to use a compiled
code copy of the App(s) under your User Account on one (1) or
more mobile devices owned or controlled solely by you (except to
the extent Apple or Google permits any shared access and/or use
of the iOS App or Android App (as each of those terms is defined
below), respectively), solely in accordance with these Terms.
The foregoing license grant is not a sale of any App or of any
copy thereof. You may not: (a) modify, disassemble, decompile,
or reverse engineer any App, except to the extent that such
restriction is expressly prohibited by Applicable Law; (b) rent,
lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise
transfer any App to any third party, or use any App to provide
time sharing or similar services for any third party; (c) make
any copies of any App; (d) remove, circumvent, disable, damage,
or otherwise interfere with security-related features of any
App, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any
content accessible through any App, or features that enforce
limitations on use of the Apps; or (e) delete the copyright or
other proprietary rights notices on any App. You acknowledge
that we may, from time to time, issue upgraded versions of the
Apps, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version
of the App that you are using on your mobile device. You consent
to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and you
understand and acknowledge that the terms and conditions of
these Terms will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party
code that may be incorporated into an App is covered by the
applicable open source or third-party license, if any,
authorizing use of such code. We or our third-party partners or
suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in and to the
Apps (and any copies thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer or
delegate any of the rights, duties, or obligations hereunder,
except as expressly provided for in these Terms, is void. We
reserve all rights not expressly granted under these Terms.</p>

no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the iOS
App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs,
or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any
warranty will be governed solely by these Terms and any law
applicable to xAI as provider of the iOS App. You and xAI
acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any
claims of you or any third party relating to the iOS App or your
possession and/or use of the iOS App, including, but not limited
to: (a) product liability claims; (b) any claim that the iOS App
fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory
requirement; and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or
similar legislation. You acknowledge that, in the event of any

of that iOS App, infringes that third party&#x27;s intellectual
property rights, xAI, not Apple, will be solely responsible for
the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any
such intellectual property infringement claim, to the extent

<h4 id="14-governing-law-arbitration-and-class-actionjury-trial-waiver">14. <strong><u>Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</u></strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> You agree that: (a) the Service will be
deemed solely based in the State of Nevada; and (b) the Service
will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal
jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in
jurisdictions other than Nevada. These Terms will be governed by
the internal substantive laws of the State of Nevada, without
respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties
acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving
interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences
with respect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the
Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be
amended, &quot;<strong>FAA</strong>&quot;) governs the interpretation and enforcement
of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws
(and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to
any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration
Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed
by the law of the U.S. state where you live (if applicable) or
the jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in writing by you and us.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You
agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts located in Clark County, Nevada for any
actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation,
or violation of our data security, Confidential Information, or
intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Arbitration
Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to
prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Clark County, Nevada is
the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration
award, or for trial court proceedings in the event that the
Arbitration Agreement below is found to be unenforceable. These
Terms were drafted in the English language and this English
language version of the Terms is the original, governing
instrument of the understanding between you and us. In the event
of any conflict between the English version of these Terms and
any translation, the English version will prevail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>
<p>a.  <u>General</u>. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE
IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND
LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM
US. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and
governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and
us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly:
(i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach,
termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and
enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the
Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing
communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using
the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship
or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a User
or consumer (each, a &quot;<strong>Claim</strong>,&quot; and, collectively,
&quot;<strong>Claims</strong>&quot;). This Arbitration Agreement will apply,
without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were
asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.</p>
<p>b.  <u>Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement</u>. If you
are a new User, you can reject and opt out of this
Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting
these Terms by emailing us at
<a href="mailto:support@x.ai">support@x.ai</a> with your
full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this
Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration
Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other
part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding
controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be
brought.</p>
<p>c.  <u>Dispute-Resolution Process</u>. For any Claim, you
will first contact us at legal@x.ai and attempt to resolve
the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that we
have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days,
we each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through
binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the
&quot;<strong>Arbitrator</strong>&quot;), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration
Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the &quot;<strong>Rules</strong>&quot;), except
as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at
<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">www.jamsadr.com</a>,
where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict
between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this
Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be
conducted in the U.S. county where you live (if applicable)
or San Francisco, California, unless you and xAI agree
otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial
purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS
filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in
accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the
Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable
attorneys&#x27; fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other
witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for
non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a
fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for
and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the
award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of
arbitration, your reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees, and your
reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and
(iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent
jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this
would not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the
informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the
award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court
of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the
Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or
agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any
disputes relating to the scope, interpretation,
applicability, enforceability, or formation of this
Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any
part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The
Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all
threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to
whether these Terms are, or whether any provision of these
Terms is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to
arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches,
unconscionability, and/or estoppel.</p>
<p>d.  <u>Equitable Relief</u>. NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION
AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING
INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS
NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT,
MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY,
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS;
OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS
COURT, PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE
MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN
INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND
NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.</p>
<p>e.  <u>Severability</u>. If this Arbitration Agreement is
found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in
part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in
whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void,
unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part,
will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this
Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the
parties&#x27; ability to compel arbitration of any remaining
Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class
Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void,
unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it
would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief,
then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief
(and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and
may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.
All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under
this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its
terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute
regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will
be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in
arbitration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> BY ENTERING INTO THESE
TERMS, YOU AND XAI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY
OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION,
COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
MEMBER. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO ALL USERS (BOTH NATUAL PERSONS
AND ENTITIES), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE OBTAINED OR USED
THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS
CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION,
AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#x27;S OR ENTITY&#x27;S CLAIMS. YOU AND
XAI AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN
INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE
RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT
AFFECT OTHER USERS.</p>
