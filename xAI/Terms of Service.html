<p>you have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person referred to or mentioned in the Input, if any, to use such person’s name, voice, and likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you have obtained, and are solely responsible for obtaining, all consents required by Applicable Law to provide Input relating to third parties;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your Input and Output (defined below) and our use thereof as contemplated by these Terms and the Service will not violate any Applicable Law or infringe any rights of any third party, including, but not limited to, any intellectual property rights and privacy rights;</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>WE CLAIM NO OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OVER YOUR INPUT. WE TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR ANY INPUT. YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INPUT AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUBMITTING, POSTING, DISPLAYING, PROVIDING, SHARING, OR OTHERWISE MAKING IT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, AND YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE ACTING ONLY AS A PASSIVE CONDUIT FOR YOUR ONLINE DISTRIBUTION AND PUBLICATION OF YOUR INPUT.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xAI Intellectual Property.</strong> You understand and acknowledge that we (or our licensors, including other Users, as applicable) own and will continue to own all rights (including intellectual property rights), title, and interest in and to the Service–but excluding your Input and Output–all materials and content displayed or otherwise made available on and/or through the Service (including, without limitation, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, photographs, audio, videos, music), and all software, algorithms, code, technology, and intellectual property underlying and/or included in or with the Service (collectively and individually, “<strong>xAI Intellectual Property</strong>”). Except as may be explicitly provided herein, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to create a license in or under any such intellectual property rights, and you will not access, sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, display, perform, publish, adapt, edit, or create derivative works of any xAI Intellectual Property. Use of any xAI Intellectual Property for any purpose not expressly permitted by these Terms is strictly prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Output.</strong> As between us and you, you own the Output. You shall not represent that Output was human-generated or use the Output to train your own machine learning models.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR SERVICE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GENERALLY, THE OUTPUT MAY NOT BE UNIQUE ACROSS USERS AND OTHER USERS MAY RECEIVE THE SAME OR SIMILAR OUTPUT FROM OUR SERVICE.</p>
<p>GIVEN THE PROBABILISTIC NATURE OF MACHINE LEARNING, USE OF THE SERVICE MAY IN SOME SITUATIONS RESULT IN OUTPUT THAT DOES NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT REALITY, PEOPLE, PLACES OR FACTS. YOU MUST EVALUATE ANY OUTPUT FOR ACCURACY AND APPROPRIATENESS FOR YOUR USE CASE, INCLUDING BY USING HUMAN REVIEW AND/OR SEEKING PROFESSIONAL ADVICE AS APPROPRIATE.</p>
<p>YOU MUST NOT USE ANY OUTPUT RELATING TO A PERSON FOR ANY PURPOSE THAT COULD HAVE A LEGAL OR MATERIAL IMPACT ON THAT PERSON, SUCH AS MAKING CREDIT, EDUCATIONAL, EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, INSURANCE, LEGAL, LAW ENFORCEMENT, CITIZENSHIP, MEDICAL, OR OTHER IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT THEM.</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE OUTPUT MAY CONTAIN “HALLUCINATIONS” AND MAY BE INACCURATE, OBJECTIONABLE, INAPPROPRIATE, OR OTHERWISE NOT SUITABLE FOR YOUR PURPOSE, AND YOU AGREE THAT WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY ALLEGES TO INCUR AS A RESULT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OUTPUT OR OTHER CONTENT GENERATED BY OR ACCESSED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE.</p>
<p>“UNHINGED MODE” IS A BETA TECHNOLOGY INTENDED TO BE OBJECTIONABLE, INAPPROPRIATE, AND OFFENSIVE, MUCH LIKE AN AMATEUR STAND-UP COMIC WHO IS STILL LEARNING THE CRAFT. YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THIS MODE, WHERE AVAILABLE, UNLESS YOU AGREE TO INTERACT WITH SUCH MATERIAL.</p>
<p>Certain features of the Service may allow you to share Input and Output with others, including through your social networks or other third-party services, such as X. If you share Input or Output from the Service with others, you authorize xAI to share those materials with the applicable third party. Please review the policies of any third-party service providers you share Input or Output with or through for additional information about how they may use those materials. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INPUT OR OUTPUT YOU SHARE WITH OTHERS, INCLUDING VIA SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 2.2 ABOVE.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Usage Data.</strong> We may collect, or you may provide to us, diagnostic, technical, usage, and/or related information, including information about your computers, mobile devices, systems, and software (collectively, “<strong>Usage Data</strong>”). All Usage Data is and will be owned solely and exclusively by us, and, to the extent any ownership rights in or to the Usage Data vest in you, you hereby assign to us all rights (including intellectual property rights), title, and interest in and to same. Accordingly, we may use, maintain, and/or process the Usage Data or any portion thereof for any lawful purpose, including, without limitation: (a) to provide and maintain the Service; (b) to improve our products and services (including the Service), and to develop new products, services, and/or features; (c) to monitor your usage of the Service; (d) for research and analytics, including, without limitation, data analysis, identifying usage trends, and/or customer research; and (e) to share analytics and other derived Usage Data with third parties, solely in de-identified or aggregated form. The Service may contain technological measures designed to prevent unauthorized or illegal use of the Service; you understand and acknowledge that we may use these and other lawful measures to verify your compliance with these Terms and to enforce our rights, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Service.</p>

We hereby grant you a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, and freely revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the App(s) under your User Account on one (1) or more mobile devices owned or controlled solely by you (except to the extent Apple or Google permits any shared access and/or use of the iOS App or Android App (as each of those terms is defined below), respectively), solely in accordance with these Terms. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of any App or of any copy thereof. You may not: (a) modify, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any App, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by Applicable Law; (b) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer any App to any third party, or use any App to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (c) make any copies of any App; (d) remove, circumvent, disable, damage, or otherwise interfere with security-related features of any App, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through any App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the Apps; or (e) delete the copyright or other proprietary rights notices on any App. You acknowledge that we may, from time to time, issue upgraded versions of the Apps, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the App that you are using on your mobile device.

You and xAI acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as relates to your license of the iOS App, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as relates to your license of the iOS App against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> You agree that: (a) the Service will be deemed solely based in the State of Texas; and (b) the Service will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Texas. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Texas, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, “<strong>FAA</strong>”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S. state where you live (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Confidential Information, or intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Tarrant County, Texas is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award, or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration Agreement below is found to be unenforceable. These Terms were drafted in the English language and this English language version of the Terms is the original, governing instrument of the understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between the English version of these Terms and any translation, the English version will prevail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>General. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a User or consumer (each, a “<strong>Claim</strong>,” and, collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement. If you are a new User, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@x.ai">support@x.ai</a> with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dispute-Resolution Process. For any Claim, you will first contact us at legal@x.ai and meet and confer to attempt  to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “<strong>Arbitrator</strong>”), under the Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”), except as provided herein. AAA may be contacted at www.adr.org, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference, unless the Arbitrator determines it must be in person, in which case it will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live (if applicable) or Tarrant County, Texas, unless you and xAI agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are, or whether any provision of these Terms is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equitable Relief. NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT, PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severability. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND XAI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO ALL USERS (BOTH NATURAL PERSONS AND ENTITIES), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. YOU AND XAI AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</p>
