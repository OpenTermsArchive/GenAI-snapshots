    <ol class="list-decimal pl-4">
      <li>In order for you to use the Service&#39;s free trial or paid version, please register a user account according to the procedure specified by SOUNDRAW. When registering your account, you must provide accurate information. In the free trial version, you will only be able to use certain features of the Service that we specify.</li>
      <li>You must not use the account of another person without the permission of SOUNDRAW. In addition, you must not allow other persons (or, if the user is a corporation, persons who do not belong to said corporation) to use your user account, nor must you transfer it, gift it, offer it as collateral or dispose of it in any other way.</li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for keeping your user account password confidential and secure.</li>
      <li>You are liable for any damage arising due to failure on your part to keep your password secure, erroneous use or use by a third party, etc., and SOUNDRAW assumes no responsibility whatsoever.</li>
      <li>If your password has been leaked to a third party, or if you suspect that your user account and password are being used by a third party, you must immediately notify SOUNDRAW of the fact and follow any instructions we may give you. In such case, SOUNDRAW will be able to suspend the user account and password as being a compromised user account and password.</li>
      <li>You are obligated to change your password regularly, and SOUNDRAW assumes no responsibility for any damage caused by your failing to fulfill this obligation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Article 3 (Use)</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-4">
      <li>You may use the Service after you have agreed to the contents of these Terms of Service.</li>
      <li>In the event that you intend to switch to the paid version during the free trial period under the preceding paragraph, please follow the procedure we specify. When you have switched to the paid version, these Terms of Service will apply.</li>
      <li>In the event of any illegal use of the service, SOUNDRAW maintains the right, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, to deny service, suspend accounts, or cancel the license to use any or all of SOUNDRAW's services. Any loss or harm suffered by the user as a result of account suspension or termination due to unlawful use is not our responsibility.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-2xl">Article 4 (Fee for using the service)</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-4">
      <li>The fee for use of the service shall be in accordance with the separately determined plans (https://soundraw.io/). No refund will be given in the event that you cancel part-way through the subscription period. However, a refund is possible if you contact us within one week of starting your subscription and if you haven’t downloaded any songs from SOUNDRAW.</li>
      <li>Your payment to SOUNDRAW will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your paid subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. In the case of a monthly plan, the payment is routinely renewed starting from the subscription starting date in increments of one month.</br> For annual subscriptions, the payment automatically renews after the first year in one-year increments.</br> Example: if you subscribe to a monthly plan on June 29, 2021, the payment will automatically renew on July 29, 2021.</br> Additionally, a refund is possible if you contact us within one week of your payment renewal, provided you haven’t downloaded any songs from SOUNDRAW since your payment renewal.</li>
        <li>Your payment to SOUNDRAW will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your paid subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period.</br>In the case of a monthly plan and annual plan on installment plan, the payment is routinely renewed starting from the subscription starting date in increments of one month.</br>For annual subscriptions with one-time fee, the payment automatically renews after the first year in one-year increments.</li>
        <li>For annual plans paid in installments, the total subscription fee will be divided into 12 equal payments, charged monthly. Users agree to make all installment payments as part of their subscription commitment.</br>For subscriptions paid in installments, if a user cancels their subscription before the end of the subscription period, they will be required to pay the remaining balance of the subscription fee.</li>
      <li>Payment can be done by credit card, PayPal or any other payment method as shown in our subscription flow.</li>
