obligations under these Clauses.</p><p><strong>8.1 Instructions</strong></p><ul><li><p>(a) The data exporter shall process the personal data only on documented
instructions from the data importer acting as its controller.</p></li><li><p>(b) The data exporter shall immediately inform the data importer if it
is unable to follow those instructions, including if such
instructions infringe Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or other Union or
Member State data protection law.</p></li><li><p>(c) The data importer shall refrain from any action that would prevent
the data exporter from fulfilling its obligations under Regulation
(EU) 2016/679, including in the context of sub-processing or as
regards cooperation with competent supervisory authorities.</p></li><li><p>(d) After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data
exporter shall, at the choice of the data importer, delete all
personal data processed on behalf of the data importer and certify
to the data importer that it has done so, or return to the data
importer all personal data processed on its behalf and delete
existing copies.</p></li></ul><p><strong>8.2 Security of processing</strong></p><ul><li><p>(a) The Parties shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including
during transmission, and protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter &lsquo;personal data breach&rsquo;). In assessing the appropriate level of
security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature of the personal data
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&amp;from=FR#ntr7-L_2021199EN.01003701-E0007">(reference)</a>,
the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects, and
in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of
processing can be fulfilled in that manner.</p></li><li><p>(b) The data exporter shall assist the data importer in ensuring
appropriate security of the data in accordance with paragraph (a).
In case of a personal data breach concerning the personal data
processed by the data exporter under these Clauses, the data
exporter shall notify the data importer without undue delay after
becoming aware of it and assist the data importer in addressing the
breach.</p></li><li><p>(c) The data exporter shall ensure that persons authorised to process
the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or
are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</p></li></ul><p><strong>8.3 Documentation and compliance</strong></p><ul><li><p>(a) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these
Clauses.</p></li><li><p>(b) The data exporter shall make available to the data importer all
information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations

data importer or, for data processing by the data exporter in the EU,
under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p><h3 id=clause-11>Clause 11</h3><p><strong>Redress</strong></p><ul><li>(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and
easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its
website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It
shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data
subject</li></ul><h3 id=clause-12>Clause 12</h3><p><strong>Liability</strong></p><ul><li><p>(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it
causes the other Party/ies by any breach of these Clauses.</p></li><li><p>(b) Each Party shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject

non-material damages that the Party causes the data subject by
breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.
This is without prejudice to the liability of the data exporter
under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p></li><li><p>(c) Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to
the data subject as a result of a breach of these Clauses, all
responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the
data subject is entitled to bring an action in court against any of
these Parties.</p></li><li><p>(d) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph
(c), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other Party/ies
that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their
responsibility for the damage.</p></li><li><p>(e) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a processor or

AUTHORITIES</strong></p><h3 id=clause-14>Clause 14</h3><p><strong>Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses</strong></p><ul><li><p>(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the
laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to
the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including
any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising
access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from
fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the
understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of
the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is
necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one
of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.</p></li><li><p>(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:</p><ul><li>(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the
length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;</li><li>(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination &ndash; including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities &ndash; relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards</li><li>(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.</li></ul></li><li><p>(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment
under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the
data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will
continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance
with these Clauses.</p></li><li><p>(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and
make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p></li><li><p>(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if,
after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the
contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject
to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under
paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third
country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an
application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the
requirements in paragraph (a). For Module Three: The data exporter
shall forward the notification to the controller.</p></li><li><p>(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data
exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can
no longer fulfill its obligations under these Clauses, the data
exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g.
technical or organisational measures to ensure security and
confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data
importer to address the situation [for Module Three:, if
appropriate in consultation with the controller]. The data exporter
shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate
safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by
[for Module Three: the controller or] the competent supervisory
authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be
entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the
processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract
involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this
right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless
the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated
pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.</p></li></ul><h3 id=clause-15>Clause 15</h3><p><strong>Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public
authorities</strong></p><p><strong>15.1 Notification</strong></p><ul><li><p>(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where
possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help
of the data exporter) if it:</p><ul><li>(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or</li><li>(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.</li></ul></li><li><p>(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter
and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of
destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to
obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as
much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer
agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to
demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.</p></li><li><p>(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the
data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular
intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant
information as possible on the requests received (in particular,
number of requests, type of data requested, requesting
authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome
of such challenges, etc.). [For Module Three: The data exporter
shall forward the information to the controller.]</p></li><li><p>(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to
paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it
available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p></li><li><p>(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the
data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the
data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these
Clauses.</p></li></ul><p><strong>15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation</strong></p><ul><li>(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for
disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers
granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the
request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are
reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under
the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under
international law and principles of international comity. The data
importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of
appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek
interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the
request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its
merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until
required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These
requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data
importer under Clause 14(e).</li><li>(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any
challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent
permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the
documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it
available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</li><li>(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of
information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure,
based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.</li></ul><h2 id=section-iv----final-provisions>SECTION IV &ndash; FINAL PROVISIONS</h2><h3 id=clause-16>Clause 16</h3><p><strong>Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination</strong></p><ul><li><p>(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is
unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.</p></li><li><p>(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or
unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend
the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance
is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without
prejudice to Clause 14(f).</p></li></ul><p>The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract,<br>insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these
Clauses, where:</p><ul><li>(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal
data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and
compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a<br>reasonable time and in any event within one month of<br>suspension;</li><li>(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of |
these Clauses; or</li><li>(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of
a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its
obligations under these Clauses.</li></ul><p>In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory<br>authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more
than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to<br>termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the<br>Parties have agreed otherwise.</p><ul><li>(d) The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data
exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer
shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of
local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return
or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer
warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these
Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long
as required under that local law.</li><li>(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses
where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to
Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer
of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to
which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to
other obligations applying to the processing in question under
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</li></ul><h3 id=clause-17>Clause 17</h3><p><strong>Governing law</strong></p><p>These Clauses shall be governed by the law of a country allowing for
