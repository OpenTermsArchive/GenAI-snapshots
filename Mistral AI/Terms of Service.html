Le consommateur peut obtenir une r&eacute;duction du prix en conservant le contenu num&eacute;rique ou le service num&eacute;rique, ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser int&eacute;gralement contre renoncement au contenu num&eacute;rique ou au service num&eacute;rique, si : 1&deg; Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu num&eacute;rique ou le service num&eacute;rique en conformit&eacute; ; 2&deg; La mise en conformit&eacute; du contenu num&eacute;rique ou du service num&eacute;rique est retard&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re injustifi&eacute;e ; 3&deg; La mise en conformit&eacute; du contenu num&eacute;rique ou du service num&eacute;rique ne peut intervenir sans frais impos&eacute;s au consommateur ; 4&deg; La mise en conformit&eacute; du contenu num&eacute;rique ou du service num&eacute;rique occasionne un inconv&eacute;nient majeur pour le consommateur ; 5&deg; La non-conformit&eacute; du contenu num&eacute;rique ou du service num&eacute;rique persiste en d&eacute;pit de la tentative de mise en conformit&eacute; du professionnel rest&eacute;e infructueuse.

These Traceability Measures do not allow Mistral AI to access or use the Customer&rsquo;s User Data. The Customer shall not in any way intentionally attempt to delete or alter the Traceability Measures implemented by Mistral AI. Mistral AI keeps a record of the Traceability Measures implemented into each Model. The record of Traceability Measures is subject to strict security protocols, including but not limited to a strict authorization policy. Mistral AI warrants that it permanently destroys any copy of the Model (as provided to the Customer) in its possession and control from its own IT infrastructure, as soon as such Model has been made available to the Customer.

<li>If the IT Expert&rsquo;s investigation confirms that the leaked Model can be traced back to the Customer through the implemented Traceability Measures:
<ul>
<li>Mistral AI shall send the Customer an exact copy of the IT Expert&rsquo;s report.</li>
<li>Mistral AI may terminate this Agreement immediately without prior notice and/or request from Customer indemnification under Sections 7 and 11 of the Deployment Terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the Customer shall not make or publish any public statement regarding the Leak without Mistral AI&rsquo;s prior written consent.</p>
