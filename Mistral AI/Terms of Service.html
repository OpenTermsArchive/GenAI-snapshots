responsible for ensuring You comply with the foregoing technical
requirements to utilize the Services effectively.</p><p><strong>Subscription Services.</strong> Fees may apply to certain Services. In that

Account or (c) an Account on behalf of another individual or entity
without such individual&rsquo;s or entity&rsquo;s consent.</p><p><strong>Account security.</strong> You must keep Your Identifiers secure and strictly
confidential. Mistral AI does not commit to monitoring which individual
is using Your Account. You are thus solely responsible for any action
carried out via Your Account, whether that action was carried-out by You
or not. For the avoidance of doubt, any operation carried out using Your
Account will be considered to have been carried-out by You. Therefore,
You shall (a) monitor the use of the Services and Your Account closely
and (b) notify Mistral AI at <a href=mailto:support@mistral.ai>support@mistral.ai</a> in the event of any
(suspected or confirmed) unauthorized or fraudulent use of Your Account

access the full list and description of the Services provided by Mistral
AI on the Platform and/or on the Documentation, as may be amended from
time to time.</p><p><strong>Restrictions.</strong> Certain Services may not be directly accessible,

restrictive nature of these Services is explicitly outlined on the
Platform and/or the applicable Documentation.</p><p><strong>Evolution of the Services.</strong> Subject to the applicable Terms of
Service, We reserve the right to modify, update or enhance Our Services

and Our Services may generate Outputs in return. You are solely
responsible for Your use of the Prompts and the Outputs. You shall only
use Prompts to which You own all required rights under applicable law
and do so in a manner that is consistent with the applicable law. You
shall not intentionally make the Services generate Outputs infringing
intellectual property rights, third party rights or applicable law, or
use such infringing Outputs after You become aware of such infringement.</p><p><strong>Prompt ownership</strong>. You hereby represent that You own Your Prompts.
You retain all the rights, including but not limited to the intellectual
property rights to Your Prompts. You grant Us a worldwide, revocable,
non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the
Prompts for the purpose of performing the Services, for the term of this
Agreement.</p><p><strong>Output ownership</strong>.Where applicable, We assign to You, all the
intellectual property rights in and to the Outputs, including (i) <strong>the
right to reproduce</strong>, without any limitation of number, all or part of
the Outputs (ii) <strong>the right to represent</strong>, broadcast or have
broadcasted, to communicate or make available the Outputs to the public
(iii) <strong>the right to adapt</strong>, correct, modify, improve the Outputs, the
right to make new versions of the Outputs from all or part of the
existing Outputs, the right to maintain, modify, arrange, assemble,
condense, transcribe, scan, mix, migrate, zip, unzip all or part of the
Outputs, the right to translate them into any language whatsoever
(including computer language), the right to interface them with any
software, material or database (unless otherwise stated), the right to
integrate them in any existing or future works, on any support and by
any means, (iv) <strong>the right to define</strong> and to modify the use, the
purpose of the use and the destination of the Outputs in any form, known
and unknown, existing or future, and (v) more generally, <strong>the right to
use, exploit, distribute</strong> the Output. You are allowed to exercise these
rights on any existing or future, known or unknown (i) medium including
but not limited to any printed, electronic, digital, numerical, analog,
magnetic media, (ii) mean of communication, telecommunication, or other
network including but not limited to radio, video, broadcast, satellite,
Internet, electronic. Unless otherwise stated, these rights can be
exercised for any purpose (public exploitation, private use, free, paid
for, subscription, etc.). This assignment is granted worldwide and for
the entire legal term of protection of the Outputs by the intellectual
property rights applicable as provided for by the applicable law.
However, You are expressly prohibited to use the Outputs and/or any modified or derived version of the Outputs to (directly or indirectly) to reverse engineer the Services.</p><p><strong>Output similarity</strong>. You agree that, due to the nature of Our
Services, if another User uses a Prompt similar to Yours, our Services
may generate an Output similar or identical to Yours. We do not warrant
that Your Output is not similar or identical to another User&rsquo;s Output.
Consequently and unless otherwise stated, we will not indemnify You in
case Your Output is similar or identical to another User&rsquo;s Output.</p><p><strong>Output accuracy</strong>. You acknowledge and agree that Our Services are
inherently subject to certain unpredictabilities, particularly with the
Outputs generated, as such Outputs depend on Your Prompt and as the
technology behind Our Services is complex and continuously evolving. For
the avoidance of any doubt and to the extent permitted by applicable
law, Our Services are provided without any express or implied warranty
regarding the quality or the accuracy of the Outputs. Consequently, You
agree that the Outputs generated by Our Services may be incomplete, not
up-to-date or not entirely accurate. Therefore, when using Our Services,
You must:</p><ul><li><p>Ensure the quality of Your Prompts,</p></li><li><p>Assess the accuracy and/or the suitability of the Output to your
needs before using or sharing the Output,</p></li><li><p>Include in Your Prompt any relevant safety prompt to better filter
or adapt the Output, especially if You deactivated the Filters
proposed by Mistral AI, and</p></li><li><p>Check the information generated by the Output and, in any case, not
rely on the Output as a unique source of truth and/or information,
as safe and inoffensive in every circumstance, or as a replacement
for professional guidance.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Training</strong>. You grant Us a worldwide, revocable, non-exclusive,
non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use Your User Feedback for
the purpose of training Our Model(s). This helps us improve the accuracy
of the Outputs generated by Our Model(s) and the overall efficiency
and/or safety of Our Services. This license is granted for the duration
of the intellectual property rights under applicable law. We do not use
Your Prompts and/or Your Outputs to train Our Model(s).</p><p><strong>Monitoring</strong>. We may use Your Prompts and Outputs to monitor abuse (meaning, to monitor any breach by You of the Agreement). To this end, we retain Your Prompts and Outputs for a period of thirty (30) days. If, for a legitimate purpose, You do not want Us to retain Your Prompts and Outputs, You can formulate your opt-out by sending an email at <a href=mailto:privacy@mistral.ai>legal@mistral.ai</a>.</p><p><strong>Safety</strong>. We make all our best efforts to make sure Our Services do
not generate Outputs that contain offensive, inappropriate or illicit
content. To this end, We have implemented and / or are proposing
different safety mechanisms such as Filters to Our Model(s). You may
deactivate these Filters for legitimate purposes pertaining to Your
specific Use-Case. You agree that (a) We do not warrant that the Output
generated will not be offensive, inappropriate or illicit, (b) You are
solely responsible for the use of Your Output and (c) You shall in no
way use the Output for any illicit or unlawful purpose and/or to harm
Mistral AI and/or a third party.</p><h2 id=your-obligations class=unnumbered>7. Your obligations</h2><p><strong>General obligations.</strong> You shall use Our Services in compliance with
