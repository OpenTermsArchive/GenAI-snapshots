Le consommateur a droit à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité en cas d’apparition d’un défaut de conformité durant la période de la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique. Durant ce délai, le consommateur n’est tenu d’établir que l’existence du défaut de conformité et non la date d’apparition de celui-ci.
La garantie légale de conformité emporte obligation de fournir toutes les mises à jour nécessaires au maintien de la conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique durant la durée d’enregistrement du compte du consommateur sur la plateforme.
La garantie légale de conformité donne au consommateur droit à la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique sans retard injustifié suivant sa demande, sans frais et sans inconvénient majeur pour lui.
Le consommateur peut obtenir une réduction du prix en conservant le contenu numérique ou le service numérique, ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser intégralement contre renoncement au contenu numérique ou au service numérique, si :
1° Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu numérique ou le service numérique en conformité ;
2° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique est retardée de manière injustifiée ;
3° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique ne peut intervenir sans frais imposés au consommateur ;
4° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique occasionne un inconvénient majeur pour le consommateur ;
5° La non-conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique persiste en dépit de la tentative de mise en conformité du professionnel restée infructueuse.
Le consommateur a également droit à une réduction du prix ou à la résolution du contrat lorsque le défaut de conformité est si grave qu’il justifie que la réduction du prix ou la résolution du contrat soit immédiate. Le consommateur n’est alors pas tenu de demander la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique au préalable.
Dans les cas où le défaut de conformité est mineur, le consommateur n’a droit à l’annulation du contrat que si le contrat ne prévoit pas le paiement d’un prix.
Toute période d’indisponibilité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique en vue de sa remise en conformité suspend la garantie qui restait à courir jusqu’à la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique de nouveau conforme.
Ces droits résultent de l’application des articles L. 224-25-1 à L. 224-25-31 du code de la consommation.
Le professionnel qui fait obstacle de mauvaise foi à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité encourt une amende civile d’un montant maximal de 300 000 euros, qui peut être porté jusqu’à 10 % du chiffre d’affaires moyen annuel (<a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069565&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000044138681&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid">article L. 242-18-1 du code de la consommation</a>).
Le consommateur bénéficie également de la garantie légale des vices cachés en application des articles 1641 à 1649 du code civil, pendant une durée de deux ans à compter de la découverte du défaut. Cette garantie donne droit à une réduction de prix si le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est conservé, ou à un remboursement intégral contre renonciation au contenu numérique ou au service numérique.</p></article><hr class="mt-5 mb-5"><article id=terms-of-service-la-plateforme class=markdown><h1>Terms of service La Plateforme</h1><h2 id=preamble class=unnumbered>Preamble</h2><p>Mistral AI provides an API that allows its users to use Mistral AI&rsquo;s

laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to
the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including
any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising
access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from
fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the
understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of
the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is
necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one
of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.</p></li><li><p>(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:</p><ul><li>(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the

continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance
with these Clauses.</p></li><li><p>(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and
make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p></li><li><p>(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if,
after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the
contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject
to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under
paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third
country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an
application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the
requirements in paragraph (a). For Module Three: The data exporter
shall forward the notification to the controller.</p></li><li><p>(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data
exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can
no longer fulfill its obligations under these Clauses, the data
exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g.
technical or organisational measures to ensure security and
confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data
importer to address the situation [for Module Three:, if
appropriate in consultation with the controller]. The data exporter
shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate
safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by
[for Module Three: the controller or] the competent supervisory
authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be
entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the
processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract
involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this
right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless

and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of

paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it
available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p></li><li><p>(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the
data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the
data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these

disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers
granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the
request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are
reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under
the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under
international law and principles of international comity. The data
importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of
appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek
interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the
request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its
merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until
required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These
requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data
importer under Clause 14(e).</li><li>(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any
challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent
permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the
documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it
available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</li><li>(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of
information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure,
