Le consommateur a droit à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité en cas d’apparition d’un défaut de conformité durant la période de la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique. Durant ce délai, le consommateur n’est tenu d’établir que l’existence du défaut de conformité et non la date d’apparition de celui-ci.
La garantie légale de conformité emporte obligation de fournir toutes les mises à jour nécessaires au maintien de la conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique durant la durée d’enregistrement du compte du consommateur sur la plateforme.
La garantie légale de conformité donne au consommateur droit à la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique sans retard injustifié suivant sa demande, sans frais et sans inconvénient majeur pour lui.
Le consommateur peut obtenir une réduction du prix en conservant le contenu numérique ou le service numérique, ou il peut mettre fin au contrat en se faisant rembourser intégralement contre renoncement au contenu numérique ou au service numérique, si :
1° Le professionnel refuse de mettre le contenu numérique ou le service numérique en conformité ;
2° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique est retardée de manière injustifiée ;
3° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique ne peut intervenir sans frais imposés au consommateur ;
4° La mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique occasionne un inconvénient majeur pour le consommateur ;
5° La non-conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique persiste en dépit de la tentative de mise en conformité du professionnel restée infructueuse.
Le consommateur a également droit à une réduction du prix ou à la résolution du contrat lorsque le défaut de conformité est si grave qu’il justifie que la réduction du prix ou la résolution du contrat soit immédiate. Le consommateur n’est alors pas tenu de demander la mise en conformité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique au préalable.
Dans les cas où le défaut de conformité est mineur, le consommateur n’a droit à l’annulation du contrat que si le contrat ne prévoit pas le paiement d’un prix.
Toute période d’indisponibilité du contenu numérique ou du service numérique en vue de sa remise en conformité suspend la garantie qui restait à courir jusqu’à la fourniture du contenu numérique ou du service numérique de nouveau conforme.
Ces droits résultent de l’application des articles L. 224-25-1 à L. 224-25-31 du code de la consommation.
Le professionnel qui fait obstacle de mauvaise foi à la mise en œuvre de la garantie légale de conformité encourt une amende civile d’un montant maximal de 300 000 euros, qui peut être porté jusqu’à 10 % du chiffre d’affaires moyen annuel (<a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069565&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000044138681&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid">article L. 242-18-1 du code de la consommation</a>).
Le consommateur bénéficie également de la garantie légale des vices cachés en application des articles 1641 à 1649 du code civil, pendant une durée de deux ans à compter de la découverte du défaut. Cette garantie donne droit à une réduction de prix si le contenu numérique ou le service numérique est conservé, ou à un remboursement intégral contre renonciation au contenu numérique ou au service numérique.</p></article><hr class="mt-5 mb-5"><article id="additional-terms-la-plateforme" class="markdown"><h1>Additional Terms - La Plateforme</h1><h2 id="preamble" class="unnumbered">Preamble</h2><p><strong>La Plateforme.</strong> Mistral AI provides La Plateforme, a SaaS platform that allows You to:</p><ul><li>Use Our Models through a set of APIs,</li><li>Fine-Tune Our Models through Our Fine-Tuning API,</li><li>Build and deploy conversational Agents,</li><li>Access a range of complementary Services.</li></ul><p><strong>Parties.</strong> These Additional Terms constitute a binding agreement between Mistral AI and You.</p><p><strong>Purpose and Scope.</strong> These Additional Terms set forth the rights and responsibilities of Mistral AI and You in connection with the provision and use of La Plateforme.
