<li class="mt-2"><strong>How We Administer the Service</strong></li>
</ol>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><strong>1.1 Eligibility.</strong> This is a contract between you and Fireworks. You must read and agree to these Terms before using the Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only if you can form a legally binding contract with us, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations (“<strong>Applicable Law</strong>”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any access to, or use of, the Service by anyone who is a minor (which is under the age of 18 in most jurisdictions) in any applicable jurisdiction (a “<strong>Minor</strong>”) is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms, unless such access and/or use is supervised by a parent or legal guardian (“<strong>Parent</strong>”) who: (a) has read and understands these Terms; (b) approves all rights granted, and all obligations undertaken, by the Minor hereunder; and (c) agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a Parent of a User who is a Minor, then, by allowing such Minor to access and/or use the Service, you are subject to these Terms and responsible for such Minor’s activity on the Service. With respect to the Parent of a User who is a Minor, “you,” as used in these Terms in the context of a license grant, assignment, restriction, obligation, acknowledgment, representation, warranty, or covenant, or in any similar context, means “the Parent, on behalf of the Parent and the Minor,” and “your” has the corresponding meaning. The Service is not available to any Users we previously removed from the Service.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><strong>1.2 User Accounts</strong></p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">a) Your User Account. Your account on the Service (your “<strong>User Account</strong>”) gives you access to certain services and functionalities that we may, in our sole discretion, establish and maintain as part of the Service from time to time. You acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you do not own your User Account, nor do you possess any rights to data stored by or on behalf of Fireworks on the servers running the Service. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">b) Organizational Accounts. An individual may access and/or use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity, such as that individual’s employer (such entity, an “<strong>Organization</strong>”). In such cases, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein: (a) these Terms are an agreement between (i) us and such individual and (ii) us and that Organization; (b) “you,” as used in these Terms in the context of a license grant, assignment, restriction, obligation, acknowledgment, representation, warranty, or covenant, or in any similar context, means (i) such individual <em><strong>and</strong></em> (ii) “the Organization, on behalf of the Organization and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, and other representatives who access and/or use the Service (collectively, “<strong>Org Users</strong>”)”; and “your” has the corresponding meanings; (c) such individual represents and warrants to having the authority to bind that Organization to these Terms (and, in the absence of such authority, such individual may not access, nor use, the Service); (d) such individual’s acceptance of these Terms will bind that Organization to these Terms; (e) we may disclose information regarding such individual and such individual’s access to and use of the Service to that Organization; (f) such individual’s right to access and use the Service may be suspended or terminated (and the administration of the applicable User Account may be transferred) if such individual ceases to be associated with, or ceases to use an email address associated with or provisioned by, that Organization; (g) that Organization will make all Org Users aware of these Terms’ provisions, as applicable to such Org Users, and will cause each Org User to comply with such provisions; and (h) that Organization will be solely responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of the Org Users, and any act or omission by any Org User that would constitute a breach of these Terms had it been taken by that Organization will be deemed a breach of these Terms by that Organization. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if an individual opens a User Account using an email address associated with or provisioned by an Organization, or if an Organization pays fees due in connection with such individual’s access to or use of the Service (or reimburses such individual for payment of such fees), then we may, in our sole discretion, deem such individual to be accessing and using the Service on behalf of that Organization.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">c) Connecting Via Third-Party Services. By connecting to the Service via a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service, as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials and/or access tokens for that service.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">d) Account Security. You may never use another User’s User Account without such User’s permission. When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your User Account, you will keep your User Account password(s) and/or any other authentication credentials secure, and you will not share your password(s) and/or any other authentication credentials with anyone else. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols) to protect your User Account. We will not be liable for, and expressly disclaim liability for, any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account and/or any changes to your User Account, including, without limitation, changes made by any Org User with administrator-level access to your User Account. You will notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your User Account.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">e) Notifications; Emails. By providing us with your email address, you consent to our using that email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by Applicable Law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.</p>

We may, with or without prior notice, change the Service, stop providing the Service or features of the Service to you or to Users generally, or create usage limits for the Service. We may, with or without prior notice, permanently terminate or temporarily suspend your access to your User Account and/or the Service without liability, with or without cause, and for any or no reason, including if, in our sole determination, you violate any provision of these Terms. Upon their termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><strong>1.4 Your Interactions with Other Users.</strong> YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS, INCLUDING SHARING OF INFORMATION, WITH OTHER USERS. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, BUT HAVE NO OBLIGATION, TO MONITOR DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER USERS. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS, AND FOR ANY USER’S ACTION OR INACTION, INCLUDING RELATING TO USER CONTENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).</p>

By electing to use non-free aspects of the Service, including enrolling in Subscription(s) (as defined below), you agree to the pricing and payment terms applicable to you and available at <a href="https://readme.fireworks.ai/page/pricing" class="font-medium underline underline-offset-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://readme.fireworks.ai/page/pricing</a> (as we may update them from time to time, the “<strong>Pricing and Payment Terms</strong>”). The Pricing and Payment Terms are hereby incorporated by reference herein. We may add new products and/or services for additional Fees, add or amend Fees for existing products and/or services, and/or discontinue offering any Subscriptions at any time, in our sole discretion; provided, however, that if we have agreed to a specific Subscription Term and a corresponding Subscription Fee, then that Subscription will remain in force for that Subscription Fee during that Subscription Term. Any change to the Pricing and Payment Terms will become effective in the billing cycle following our provision of notice of such change. Except as may be expressly stated in these Terms or in the Pricing and Payment Terms, all Fees must be paid in advance, payment obligations are non-cancelable once incurred (subject to any cancellation rights set forth in these Terms), and Fees paid are non-refundable. Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use, and withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, but, for clarity, excluding taxes based on our net income, “<strong>Taxes</strong>”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchases and/or Subscriptions in connection with the Service.</p>

<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">b) “<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>” means the recurring amount due as consideration for a Subscription; a Subscription Fee is one type of Fee.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">c) “<strong>Fireworks Fee</strong>” means the portion of the Fee (including any Subscription Fee) that Fireworks may retain as consideration for providing the Service or any portion thereof (including any particular Subscription), as applicable.</p>

To use non-free aspects of the Service, you must provide us with at least one (1) current, valid payment card that is accepted by us and Payment Processor (each such card, a “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”). By providing a Payment Method, you authorize each of Fireworks and Payment Processor to charge that Payment Method the applicable Fees and Taxes, including, if applicable, on a recurring basis until you cancel your Subscription (including any notice period specified in Section 8.4(c) (Cancellation Procedures)). Fees and Taxes will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated in your User Account. In some cases, your payment date may change, for example, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, if you changed your Subscription plan, or if your Subscription began on a date not contained in a subsequent month. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of Subscription in which you are enrolled, if applicable. Fees are fully earned upon payment. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of Service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to one (1) month of service as soon as you register for the Service.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">b) Third-Party Payment Processor. We or Payment Processor will attempt to verify your Payment Method(s), and may do so by processing an authorization hold, which is standard practice. To the extent Payment Processor processes payments made by you, you will be subject to terms and conditions governing the use of Payment Processor’s service. Please review such terms and conditions as well as Payment Processor’s privacy notice (each of which is available on Payment Processor’s website). You acknowledge and understand that Payment Processor may collect and retain Third-Party Fees whenever you pay Fees (including Subscription Fees). Payment must be received by Payment Processor before our acceptance of an order. We do not view or store your full credit card or other Payment Method information.

These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, “<strong>FAA</strong>”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S. state where you live (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Confidential Information, or Intellectual Property Rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award, or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration Agreement below is found to be unenforceable. These Terms were drafted in the English language and this English language version of the Terms is the original, governing instrument of the understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between the English version of these Terms and any translation, the English version will prevail.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><strong>15.2 Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">a) General. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a User or consumer (each, a “<strong>Claim</strong>,” and, collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">b) Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement. If you are a new User, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@fireworks.ai" class="font-medium underline underline-offset-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@fireworks.ai</a> with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">c) Dispute-Resolution Process. For any Claim, you will first contact us at <a href="mailto:support@fireworks.ai" class="font-medium underline underline-offset-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@fireworks.ai</a> and attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the “<strong>Arbitrator</strong>”), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the “<strong>Rules</strong>”), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/" class="font-medium underline underline-offset-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.jamsadr.com</a>, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live (if applicable) or Sussex County, Delaware, unless you and Fireworks agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are, or whether any provision of these Terms is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">d) Equitable Relief. NOTHING IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED AS: PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT, PROVIDED THAT YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">e) Severability. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><strong>15.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FIREWORKS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER. THE FOREGOING APPLIES TO ALL USERS (BOTH NATURAL PERSONS AND ENTITIES), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S CLAIMS. YOU AND FIREWORKS AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</p>
<p class="leading-7 [&amp;:not(:first-child)]:mt-6"><strong>16. U.S. Government Restricted Rights</strong></p>
