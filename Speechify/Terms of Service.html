We each acknowledge that neither of us relies on, or will have any remedies in respect of, any representation or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms or the documents referred to in them.

If we fail to comply with these Terms, we will be liable to you only for the purchase price of the Services in question. In addition, we will not be liable for:</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">    (i) Faulty operation of computers during the registration process or during completion of a subscription or during the transmission of any data and/or for incorrect or overly slow transmission of data by the internet provider and/or any damage that occurs due to information submitted by you not being received by us or not being received promptly or not being considered, as a consequence of technical faults with our software or hardware (whether or not they are within or outside of our control).</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">    (ii) Any loss or damage due to viruses or other malicious software that may infect your Device, computer equipment, software, data or other property caused by you accessing, using or downloading from the Services, or from transmissions via emails or attachments received from us.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">    (iii) Any use of websites linked to the Services but operated by third parties.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(b) To the extent permitted by law, Speechify and its affiliates, suppliers, clients, or licensors (collectively, the “Protected Entities”) shall not be liable for any consequential, exemplary or punitive damages arising from, or directly or indirectly related to, the use of, or the inability to use, the Services or the content, materials and functions related thereto, your provision of information via the Services, or lost business or lost sales, or any errors, viruses or bugs contained in the Services, even if such Protected Entity has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall the Protected Entities be liable for or in connection with any content posted, transmitted, exchanged or received by or on behalf of any user or other person on or through the Products. In no event shall the total aggregate liability of the Protected Entities to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract or tort, including, but not limited to, negligence or otherwise) arising from these terms of use or your use of the Services exceed, in the aggregate, the amount, if any, paid by you to Speechify for your use of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Speechify expressly disclaims any liability for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, business interruptions, or loss of data, whether in an action in contract, tort or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.12 PRE-LITIGATION PROCEDURE</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">To ensure efficient and equitable resolution of disputes between you (the user) and Speechify, both parties agree to abide by a mandatory Pre-Litigation Conflict Resolution Framework. This process is designed to address concerns promptly and fairly, minimizing the need for arbitration and fostering a constructive relationship. This framework seeks to balance the need for a thorough, good-faith attempt at resolution with the practicalities of managing dispute processes efficiently and securely. It emphasizes genuine engagement with the process, manages exceptions responsibly, and aims to deter frivolous claims by setting clear, structured criteria for progression through the dispute resolution stages. </p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Step 1: Initial Informal Resolution</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Before initiating any formal dispute process, the Claimant is required to engage informally to seek an informal resolution. This engagement should be a genuine effort over 14 business days to resolve the issue informally before proceeding to the next steps. If Speechify is the defendant, your informal engagement should be with our customer support available at <!-- -->.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Cool-Off Period</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Following the initial informal resolution period, a mandatory cool-off period of 14 business days is required. This period is intended to encourage both parties to resolve their differences before an official Notice of Dispute, and provides additional time to reflect on the issues in order to consider potential alternative solutions outside of formal dispute mechanisms.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Step 2: Notice of Dispute</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">If the dispute is not resolved informally, the Claimant shall prepare a Notice of Dispute, delivery of which shall which shall toll any applicable statute of limitations. Speechify is committed to the security and confidentiality of the dispute resolution process, especially personally identifiable information and settlement privilege communication for both parties. All personal user data and personal employee data, including video submissions, shall be handled in strict compliance with applicable data protection laws and use end-to-end encryption. Speechify has provided a public encryption key in our data privacy guide for encrypting relevant files available at <!-- -->, to go on a USB drive and mailed with a printed letter of identification for the Claimant. If you do not know how to use encryption, you may follow the easy instructions provided in our guide or contact our support.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">A Notice of Dispute must include:</p><ul class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-disc"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">A video statement recording explaining the dispute, your identity, and the desired outcome.</li><ul class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-disc"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">State your name and address, describe the dispute, and the the resolution or outcome you are seeking from Speechify or that we are seeking from you.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">The video should be between two and five minutes to ensure conciseness.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">Two to five minutes in a quiet, well-lit room using a simple digital camera or your smartphone, for convenience.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">If a party is represented by counsel, they shall seek their counsel’s advice and coaching for the video statement.</li></ul><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">Any supporting documentation of incidents, receipts, dates relevant to your claim, etc.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">A printed, dated letter to the defendant, notarized in-person by the Claimant with a photocopy of legal identification. If the Claimant is not an individual, then a copy of their Articles of Incorporation shall suffice. This is needed to verify the authenticity of the claim and the validity of the Claimant’s identity. Claimant shall sign the cover letter with wet ink and provide a current physical address, email address, and phone number. If the Claimant is a Speechify user, you must provide your Speechify log-in info (username and IP address, as displayed in your account settings and in a site like whatismyipaddress.com respectively). Neither party shall share the personal information of the other except for with legal counsel. Each party will retain personal information only as long as needed to resolve the legal dispute.</li><ul class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-disc"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item"><strong>(Optional) Public Key:</strong> The Claimant may provide a copy of their public key and public key of their counsel (if available) on the USB drive, to be able to receive secure communication in response. The notarized note ensures no communication is subject to man-of-the-middle attacks as the keys are provided with identity verification.</li></ul></ul><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Step 3: Sending the Notice of Dispute</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">The USB drive and notarized identification documents must be delivered by a process server or equivalent legal service professional who can provide formal acknowledgment of receipt. Upon completion of the delivery, the sender must immediately email confirmation of the service, including the date and time of delivery and the name of the person who acknowledged receipt. When sending a Notice of Dispute to Speechify, address the notice to Ofek Weitzman, CEO of Speechify. If we are the Claimant and do not have a legal name on file for you, we may send the information digitally to your email address on file, with a digital scan of the notarized dispute notice. </p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Step 4: Settlement Conference</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Upon receipt of Notice of Dispute, a mandatory settlement conference will be scheduled. This conference will take place in-person in Miami-Dade County, Florida. If a party is represented by counsel, counsel may also participate, but the Claimant (or the Claimant’s employee if a business) must be personally present. We believe that a face-to-face meeting is most conducive to resolving disputes amicably. Should exceptional circumstances prevent in-person attendance, accommodations for virtual participation may be assessed on a case-by-case basis; please provide proof of disability if you have one.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Financial Hardship Considerations:</strong> – Participants claiming financial travel hardship may provide evidence of their financial statusin the form of a declaration under oath regarding monthly income and the number of persons in the consumer’s household alongside their legal name, date of birth, and home address for travel booking. Speechify will consider subsidizing travel costs for eligible participants. This may include booking air or bus travel to Miami-Dade. You accept that applying for subsidy may delay the agreed settlement conference date in order to enable Speechify to secure cost-effective travel arrangements for you with an advanced enough purchase of tickets by air, train, or bus. Speechify will book travel directly on your behalf for a day trip to the conference. Speechify may consider offering you temporary one-night housing at its sole discretion and on a case-by-case basis. Travel accommodation is not guaranteed.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">If these considerations are not sufficient for you, you may consider applying for our expedited dispute route. If Speechify denies travel subsidy despite you being at or near federal poverty guidelines then the conference shall be virtual.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Step 5: Mediation</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">If the dispute remains unresolved 14 days after the settlement conference, both parties agree to participate in mediation. We believe that face-to-face mediation is most conducive to resolving disputes amicably, and the mediation will be scheduled with you in Miami-Dade county, following similar considerations for extenuating circumstances as the Settlement Conference. If a party is represented by counsel, counsel may also participate. You and Speechify will mutually select a qualified mediator based in Miami-Dade County to facilitate this process.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Moving to Litigation</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, the parties will proceed to initiate formal litigation proceedings, as outlined in our Arbitration Agreement.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Exceptions to Pre-Litigation</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Exceptions to Pre-Litigation are outlined in Section 13.13 Expedited Dispute Resolution for Urgent Bona Fide User Claims. Additionally, this section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the claims seeking any relief or remedy measures against unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of Speechify’s intellectual property, AI models, trademarks, patents, or copyright.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Speechify is committed to resolving disputes fairly and efficiently. We believe that most disputes can be resolved through open dialogue and mutual understanding. This Pre-Arbitration Conflict Resolution Framework is designed to facilitate this goal, ensuring that all parties have the opportunity to express their views and seek resolution in a structured and respectful environment.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.13 EXPEDITED DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR URGENT BONA FIDE CLAIMS</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">To ensure our dispute resolution process is both fair and efficient, we recognize the need to accommodate legitimate concerns that merit expedited attention. This section outlines our criteria and process for considering requests to modify or bypass certain pre-arbitration requirements for claims deemed bona fide and/or urgent based on objective and reasonable criteria.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Criteria for Bona Fide Claims</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">A claim may be considered bona fide and eligible for expedited or modified processing if it meets any of the following criteria:</p><ol class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-decimal"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item"><strong>Immediacy and Harm</strong>: The claim involves an issue where delay could result in irreparable harm or significant ongoing inconvenience to the Claimant.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item"><strong>Financial Impact</strong>: The claim pertains to a financial transaction involving the Claimant that involves a significant amount of money relative to the typical transactions made on our platform.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item"><strong>Substantial Hardship</strong>: The user demonstrates that following the standard process would cause substantial hardship due to extraordinary circumstances such as severe health issues or geographic limitations.</li></ol><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Request Process</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Users may request expedited or modified dispute resolution by submitting a written request that includes:</p><ul class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-disc"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">A clear explanation of the claim.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">Specific reasons why the claim meets one or more of the bona fide criteria listed above.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">Any supporting documentation or evidence that substantiates the user’s claims and the necessity for an expedited process.</li></ul><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Review and Decision</strong></p><ul class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-disc"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">Requests for expedited processing will be reviewed by a dedicated team within 5 business days of submission.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">Decisions will be communicated clearly to the user with an explanation of the reasons for the decision.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">If a request is approved, the dispute will be fast-tracked according to modified procedures that may include remote mediation or a simplified review process.</li></ul><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Transparency and Fairness</strong></p><ul class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-disc"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">All users, regardless of their account type (paid or free) or the duration of their use of our platform, are entitled to request consideration under this framework.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">We commit to treating each request with fairness and integrity, assessing each based on the merits of the information provided without bias.</li></ul><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong></p><ul class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-disc"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">We will regularly review the outcomes and feedback from the expedited dispute resolution process to ensure it meets our standards of fairness and effectiveness.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item">Adjustments will be made as necessary to improve the process and address any emerging needs or challenges.</li></ul><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.14 ARBITRATION</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY, AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH SPEECHIFY, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM SPEECHIFY.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products that cannot be resolved by Pre-Litigation or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Speechify are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(b) Arbitration Rules. This arbitration provision is governed by applicable arbitration laws, including the Federal Arbitration Act for U.S. users and equivalent arbitration laws for international users. Arbitration will be initiated through the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) or, if applicable, the Center for Effective Dispute Resolution (“CEDR”). The rules of the chosen arbitral forum will govern all aspects of the arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms.<br/></p><ol class="list mb-7 ml-10 list-decimal"><li class="mb-2.5 list-item"><strong>Claims Under $10,000</strong>: (a) Most small claim courts will resolve disputes up to $8,000. (b) If the claim cannot be resolved in small claims court, the initiating party may choose ICC arbitration. However, please be aware that ICC arbitration can require an advance of $8,000 or more in fees. To make this option accessible for claims under $8,000 which cannot be resolved in small claims court Speechify will split all fees 50-50 with the initiating party if they prefer ICC arbitration over small claims court. “Split all fees 50-50” means that all fees and arbitrator time, including those billed to the consumer and those billed to Speechify, will be shared equally. (c) If the claim cannot be resolved in small claims court and Speechify is subscribed to CEDR’s consumer services at the time of the dispute, then arbitration may be conducted under the UNCITRAL Rules as administered by CEDR. Information on CEDR’s rules and case submission is available at <a href="https://www.cedr.com/alternative-dispute-resolution-processes/arbitration/rules/" target="_blank" class="text-electric-800">CEDR Arbitration Rules</a> and <a href="https://www.cedr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/uncitral-arb-rules.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-electric-800">UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules</a>.

The Emergency Arbitrator Provisions shall not apply. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator with at least five years of experience in computer software law or if unavailable then in the education sector. </strong>(b) The rules and procedures of the ICC can be accessed at <a href="https://iccwbo.org/dispute-resolution/dispute-resolution-services/arbitration/rules-procedure/2021-arbitration-rules/" target="_blank" class="text-electric-800">ICC Arbitration Rules</a>.

If the parties cannot agree on a location, the arbitration will either be sided by the arbitration forum or take place virtually. (b) If both ICC and CEDR are unavailable, the parties will mutually select an alternative arbitral forum and will split all fees including the arbitrator’s time. (c) The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. Rulings and disputes regarding payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses may be resolved at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</li><li class="mb-2.5 list-item"><strong>Third-Party Services.</strong> As mentioned in our terms of service, third-party services such as links and embeddings to utilities like Facebook’s “like” button, Google Fonts, and more, that may be present on this website, are all governed and subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies, especially in the event that you are a registered user of that company. You agree to pursue any such claims directly with the third party instead of pursuing any form of arbitration or litigation against Speechify for services provided by third parties. However, if a claim arises that is substantially related to the specific means by which Speechify uses a third-party service, then you may proceed but must interplead such third party yourself as a co-defendant in the initial submission. If the arbitration forum chosen does not permit naming that entity, for example because they are not members of that forum, then Speechify shall decide whether to (i) accept the arbitration forum that the third party is a member of instead, presuming that such forum permits co-defendants, and presuming that Speechify agrees to the rules of that arbitration forum, and presuming that the user is registered to the third-party company or otherwise consented at the time of claim or previously to the third-party arbitration forum’s rules, or (ii) permit the arbitration to proceed without the third party being named, or (iii) permit the case to proceed not in arbitration but in an individualized court case subject to the Exclusive Venue section below; importantly such decision by Speechify shall be on an individualized case basis and therefore in no event shall it lift the class action waiver of this agreement.</li></ol><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(c) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Speechify. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Speechify.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(d) Jury Trial Waiver. You and Speechify waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Rather, you and Speechify elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and Speechify over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Speechify waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(e) Class Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND SPEECHIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Speechify are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth below.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(f) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Speechify may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(g) Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Speechify.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">(h) Each party will bear its own attorney fees and costs, and neither party may request or demand the attorney fees of the other party, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, except that the arbitrator at his own discretion, if not directly requested, may award fees and costs—or partial fees and costs—if he feels that the claim was meritless, or frivolous, or abusive, or that it was brought about more as a means of enriching the claimant and their counsel than as a means of rectifying bona fide damage, or that it was otherwise brought for an improper as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).<br/></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.15 EXCLUSIVE VENUE</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Speechify agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of Florida.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.16 CHOICE OF LAW</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of Florida, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.17 SEVERABILITY</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be modified to reflect the parties’ intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remainder of the Terms will continue in full force and effect and be enforceable.  In no event shall any such modification or elimination affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision or sub-subsection.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.18 STATUTE OF LIMITATION</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of Speechify’s services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year and twenty-eight (28) days after such claim or cause of action arose. Any claim or cause of action not filed within this time period will be forever barred. This limitation period shall not apply where prohibited by law.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.19 TERMS GOVERN PAST DISPUTES</strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">These terms, including its specific arbitration and pre-dispute rules as of this date, apply to all users, regardless of when they initially agreed to these Terms or when their dispute-related events occurred. The governing terms will be those in effect at the time legal notice is given to lock in the terms of such a date. This ensures consistency and fairness in resolving disputes under the most current terms with fewer administrative burdens on parties to retain multiple versions of terms. By continuing to use Speechify’s services and not providing us with notice of termination, you agree that these terms and their arbitration provisions apply for past disputes.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4"><strong>13.20 UNCONSCIONABILITY CHALLENGES </strong></p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Speechify strives to provide ethical and conscionable terms in our agreements. If you or your legal counsel believe that any terms in this agreement “shock the conscience,” you agree to notify us immediately by email at <!-- --> prior to signing up, or within seven (7) days of any notice from us requesting that you review our terms, or otherwise on the same day such a belief arises. Your notification must include a detailed description of the specific term or phrase that you find objectionable, along with proper reasoning and explanation.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">Upon receiving your notification, Speechify will have the opportunity to propose individualized redlines to the terms for your specific situation. If you agree to our proposed redlines via email, you waive any further right to challenge the conscionability of these terms. Furthermore, you agree not to challenge the conscionability of these terms without first informing us in accordance with this section and providing us with a reasonable opportunity to respond.</p><p class="mb-5 ml-4">This process ensures that any concerns regarding the conscionability of the terms are addressed promptly and fairly, rather than in the midst of litigation, and that users considering signing up do not experience a “take-it-or-leave-it” approach to our terms, fostering a cooperative and transparent relationship between us and our users.</p><p class="mb-5">‍</p><p
