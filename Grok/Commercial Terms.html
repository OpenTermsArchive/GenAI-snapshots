Customer shall not represent that Output was human-generated or use the Output to train Customer’s or its providers’ machine learning or AI models. Due to the nature of machine learning and AI, the Output may not be unique across users and the Service may generate the same or similar Output for other users. Use of the Service may result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect reality. Customer must evaluate the accuracy of any Output as appropriate for Customer’s use case, including by using human review of the Output. Customer understands and agrees that the Output may contain “hallucinations” and may be inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate, or otherwise unsuited to Customer’s purpose, and Customer agrees that xAI shall not be liable for any damages Customer or any third party alleges to incur as a result of or relating to any Output or other content generated by or accessed on or through the Service. If Customer shares Input or Output from the Service with others, Customer authorizes xAI to share those materials with the applicable third party. Customer is responsible for complying with relevant third-party policies when it instructs xAI to transmit Output to those third parties.  Collectively, Input and Output are referred to as “<strong>User Content</strong>.”</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>De-identified Data and Data Retention</strong>. xAI may create and use de-identified data related to Customer’s use of the Services to improve xAI’s products and services, to develop new products and services, and for its other business purposes (and such de-identified data will be owned by xAI). For clarity, subject to Section 3.2, xAI shall not use any User Content for any of its internal AI or other training purposes (such as training its machine learning models), including developing new products or services based on User Content. User Content is automatically deleted within 30 days, unless (a) xAI is legally required to retain it, or (b) it is flagged for safety, compliance, or moderation issues or as potentially violating this Agreement or the AUP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third-Party Application Service Providers</strong>. Customer may be able to access and use certain optional third-party services or products (e.g., a third-party service that integrates with xAI via opt-in, or uses xAI’s APIs) through or with its use of the Services (“<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”). Customer is under no obligation to use any Third-Party Services. Additionally, all or some portions of the Services may be subject to additional and/or separate terms and conditions, including but not limited to open-source software licenses and other third-party software license terms and conditions (“<strong>Third-Party Terms</strong>”).

<li>
<p><strong>Indemnification by xAI</strong>.  xAI shall indemnify and defend Customer from and against any claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable outside attorneys’ fees and costs) arising from infringement of patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right asserted against Customer by a third party based upon Customer’s use of the Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided that xAI shall have received from Customer: (a) prompt written notice of such claim; (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement (if applicable) of such claim (as long as such settlement releases Customer from any and all liability); and (c) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer at xAI’s expense. In addition, Customer may, at its own cost and expense, appoint its own counsel with respect to defense of the claim; and any settlement that does not provide for a full and unconditional release of Customer shall require Customer’s consent. If Customer’s use of any Service is, or in xAI’s opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the type of infringement specified above, or if required by settlement, xAI may, in its sole and reasonable discretion: (x) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services; (y) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Services; or if (x) and (y) are commercially impracticable, (z) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer any unused, prepaid fees paid by Customer for the terminated period. The foregoing indemnification obligation of xAI shall not apply to the extent that the alleged infringement arises from: (1) any modification of the Services, including fine-tuning or other customization, other than by or on behalf of xAI; (2) access to or use of any Service in combination with any hardware, system, software, network, or other products, materials or services not provided by or on behalf of xAI, including the Bundled Services; (3) use of the Services in breach of this Agreement, including the AUP, Documentation, DPA, and xAI Privacy Policy; or (4) Input, Output, or any training data Customer provides to xAI, if any.

This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving: (x) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice); (y) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim (any settlement, subject to xAI’s prior written consent); and (z) all reasonably necessary cooperation of xAI at Customer’s expense.</p>

<ol class="[&amp;>li]:marker:content-[counters(list-item,'.')_'._']">
<li>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> “<strong>Confidential Information</strong>” means information disclosed by one party to the other that is marked as confidential or proprietary or that ought reasonably to be understood as confidential or proprietary. All xAI Technology, performance information relating to the Services, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the fees and pricing information) shall be deemed Confidential Information of xAI without any marking or further designation. Customer’s Confidential Information includes User Content (subject to Section 3). Confidential Information does not include information that the recipient already lawfully knew, that becomes public through no fault of the recipient, that was independently developed by the recipient without any reference to or use of Confidential Information, or that was rightfully obtained by the recipient from a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Obligations</strong>. The recipient agrees not to disclose Confidential Information except to its Affiliates, employees, contractors and agents who need to know it and have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. Only those parties may use the Confidential Information, and only to exercise the recipient’s rights and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, while using at least a reasonable degree of care to protect it. The recipient may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law after providing reasonable notice to the discloser and cooperating to obtain confidential treatment. Unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information may cause harm not compensable by damages, and the disclosing party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, without posting a bond, to protect its Confidential Information.</p>

Customer shall ensure that use of the Services and Customer and End-User User Content shall always comply with Customer privacy policies and all applicable local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and conventions, including, without limitation, those related to data privacy, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal information.</p>
