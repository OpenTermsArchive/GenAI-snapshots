<p><em>Effective: July 10, 2025</em></p>
<p>At X.AI LLC ("<strong>xAI</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>we</strong>"), we value your privacy and are committed to being fair, accountable, and transparent in how we handle your personal information. Our Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our websites and applications (the Grok mobile app (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/grok/id6670324846">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.x.grok">Android</a>) or the <a href="http://Grok.com">Grok.com</a> website), and other xAI services (our "<strong>Service</strong>"). It also describes your privacy rights.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to data that we process on behalf of customers of our business offerings, such as the xAI API, or to any employment-related personal information processed in consideration of employment with xAI. This Privacy Policy also does not apply if you access our Service through a third-party’s service. In that case, the third-party’s privacy policy would apply. For example, your use of X (previously Twitter), including use of Grok on the X platform, is governed by the <a href="https://x.com/en/privacy">X Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://x.com/en/tos">X Terms</a>, not this xAI Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>For individuals in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (collectively, “Europe”), for Europe-specific additional information not already discussed on this page, please see <a href="https://x.ai/legal/europe-privacy-policy-addendum">xAI’s Europe Privacy Policy Addendum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-how-we-may-disclose-personal-information"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#4-how-we-may-disclose-personal-information"><strong>4. How we may disclose personal information</strong></a></h2>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to others. Below, you will find examples and additional information regarding how we may disclose your personal information.</p>
<ul>
<li>To our contracted service providers: To assist in providing the Service to you or performing business operations, we provide your personal information to service providers including providers of hosting, cloud, analytics, content delivery, support and safety monitoring, payment and transaction, and other technology services, for the purposes described above.</li>

<h2 id="5-retention-of-personal-information"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#5-retention-of-personal-information"><strong>5. Retention of personal information</strong></a></h2>
<p>We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. In certain circumstances, we will retain your information for legal reasons after our contractual relationship has ended. The specific retention periods depend on the nature of the information and why it is collected and processed and the nature of the legal requirement. For example, we may retain your personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we have a legal obligation to do so (e.g., if we receive a court order, we would retain your information for longer than our usual retention periods);</li>
<li>To address and resolve requests and complaints (e.g., if there is an ongoing complaint about you);</li>
<li>To protect the safety, security, and integrity of our business and the Service, as well as to protect our rights and property and those of others (e.g., if we detect misuse of our Service or otherwise detect unusual activity on your account or in your interactions with us); and</li>
<li>For litigation, regulatory or other legal matters (e.g., we would retain your information if there was an ongoing legal claim and the information was relevant to the claim).</li>
</ul>
<p>The length of time we retain data may depend on the features or settings you use. For example, when Private Chat is turned on, conversations will not appear in your conversation history and your conversations will be deleted from xAI systems within 30 days unless it is necessary that they be kept longer for legal, compliance, or safety purposes. Further, if you choose to delete any or all of your conversations or if you choose to delete your account, we will delete the data within 30 days unless it is necessary to retain the data for legal, compliance, or safety purposes.</p>

<p>xAI implements commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures designed to protect personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measure or method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

<h2 id="7-links-to-other-websites"><a class="heading-anchor" href="#7-links-to-other-websites"><strong>7. Links to other websites</strong></a></h2>

<li>If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.

<li>The right to submit certain privacy requests through an Authorized Agent.</li>
<li>The right to be free from discrimination for exercising the rights afforded to you under applicable privacy laws.</li>

<p>Exercising your rights: Some of these rights may be exercised in the xAI Service but for others you will need to submit a request at <a href="https://xai-privacy.relyance.ai/">https://xai-privacy.relyance.ai/</a> and include your full legal name, email address, and city, state/province, and country of residence. Once you have submitted your request, we will respond within the time frame permitted by applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that your personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using your information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If an exception applies, we will inform you when responding to your request.</p>
<p>Verification: In order to protect your personal information, your ability to exercise some of the rights detailed in this Privacy Policy may be subject to your ability to verify that you are the person about whom your request pertains.

<p>Authorized Agents: To exercise your rights using an Authorized Agent (as defined under applicable law), you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf. We reserve the right to deny a request from an Authorized Agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>Appeals: If we refuse to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after receiving your request, you may appeal our decision via <a href="https://xai-privacy.relyance.ai/">https://xai-privacy.relyance.ai/</a>. In such an appeal, you must (1) provide sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom the original request pertains and to identify the original request, and (2) provide a description of the basis of your appeal. Please note that your appeal will be subject to your rights and obligations afforded to you under applicable law.
