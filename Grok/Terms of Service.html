Miscellaneous.</h2><p><strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong>. xAI and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (xAI and all such parties together, the “xAI Parties”) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation, regarding any Materials. The xAI Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services, including without limitation any Materials, or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE XAI PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<p><strong>Indemnity</strong>. You agree to indemnify and hold the xAI Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), the Materials, or any products or services that you develop, produce, market or distribute using or otherwise in connection with the Services and (b) your violation of these Terms.<p><strong>Trademarks</strong>. You may not use our names, logos, trademarks, service marks or other identifiers without our prior written consent.<p><strong>Assignment</strong>. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without xAI’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.<p><strong>Choice of Law</strong>. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.<p><strong>Arbitration</strong>. Please read the following ARBITRATION PROVISION carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with xAI and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from xAI. Both you and xAI acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, xAI’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof. - <em>Arbitration Rules</em>; Applicability of Arbitration. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Clark County, Nevada. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. - <em>Costs of Arbitration</em>. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. xAI will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. xAI will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. - <em>Small Claims Court</em>; Infringement. Either you or xAI may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Clark County, Nevada or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. - <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>. YOU AND XAI WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and xAI are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and xAI over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND XAI WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge. - <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor xAI is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (vii) below. - <em>Opt-out</em>. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: X.AI Corporation 216 Park Road Burlingame, CA 94010, postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (a) your name and residence address, (b) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (c) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration provision. - <em>Exclusive Venue</em>. If you send the opt-out notice in (vi), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration provision permits either you or xAI to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration provision will not apply to either party, and both you and xAI agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Clark County, Nevada, or the federal district in which that county falls. - <em>Severability</em>. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this arbitration provision will be null and void. This arbitration provision will survive the termination of your relationship with xAI.<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing and reporting all taxes, duties and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that xAI may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and xAI agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and xAI, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner or joint venture of xAI, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind xAI in any respect whatsoever. Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration provision, you and xAI agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</div></div></section></div><footer><div class=container><div class=footer-content><img alt="xAI Logo" src=/inverse_xai_logo_5.svg><div class=left>xAI Corp (<a href=https://x.com/xai>@xAI</a>) © 2023<br> All rights reserved.</div><div class=right><a href=/legal/terms-of-service/> Terms of use </a><br><a href=/legal/privacy-policy/> Privacy Policy </a><br></div></div></div></footer><script data-cfasync="false" src="/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script><script [data-swup-ignore-script] src=https://x.ai/main.js></script>
