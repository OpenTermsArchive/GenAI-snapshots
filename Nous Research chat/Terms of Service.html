Using the Nous Research Services</h2><h3>5.1 Establishing an Account.</h3><p>Certain features, functions, parts or elements of the Nous Research Services can be used or accessed only by holders of an Account. The person who wishes to create an Account must:</p><ol><li>complete the sign-up form on the Web Site; and</li><li>accept these Terms by clicking “Sign up” or other similar button</li></ol><p>Each Client may have only one Account. If several persons need to use an Account on behalf of Client, Client must designate such persons as Users. Each such User shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p><p>If Client has designated Users and granted them Authorization, such Users will be deemed to be authorized to act on behalf of Client when using the Account. Nous Research is not responsible for and shall have no liability for verifying the validity of Authorization of any User. However, Nous Research may, in its discretion, request additional information or proof of the person&#x27;s credentials. If Nous Research is not certain if a User has been granted Authorization, Nous Research may, in its sole discretion, prevent such User from accessing the Nous Research Services.</p><p>A User may be associated with multiple Clients and Accounts. Deleting a User from one Account will not remove the User from the Platform if he/she is connected to multiple Accounts.</p><p>The Client and any User associated with an Account must provide Nous Research with true, accurate, current, and complete information about the Client, Users or Account and keep it up to date.</p><h3>5.2 Logging Into an Account.</h3><p>Nous Research shall provide Client with a username and password (“Login Credentials”) to be used to log in to its Account unless the Client uses the single sign-on feature or another service to log in. These Login Credentials must not be used by multiple persons. If Client has designated several Users, each User will be provided with separate Login Credentials. Client and each User are responsible for keeping confidential all login credentials associated with an Account. Client must promptly notify Nous Research:</p><ol><li>of any disclosure, loss or unauthorized use of any Login Credentials;</li><li>of a User&#x27;s departure from the Client&#x27;s organization;</li><li>of a change in a User&#x27;s role in the Client&#x27;s organization;</li><li>of any termination of a User&#x27;s right for any reason.</li></ol><h3>5.3 Termination of Account.</h3><p>Client may terminate these Terms at any time as provided in Section 17. Nous Research shall permanently delete the Account within six months of the effective date of the termination.</p><h3>5.4 Fees.</h3><p>The use of an Account is subject to a Fee. Upon sign-up for an Account, the Client must select a Plan. Different rates apply to different Plans. The applicable Fee is charged in advance on monthly or annual payment intervals, unless agreed otherwise between parties. All Fees are non-refundable, i.e. there are no refunds or credits for periods where the Client did not use an activated Account, used it only partially, or deactivated the Account or terminated these Terms during an ongoing payment interval. If, after signing up, Client elects to upgrade to a more expensive Plan, the unused portion of any prepaid Fees shall be applied to the Fee of the more expensive Plan.</p><p>All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies or duties applicable under any applicable law, unless stated otherwise stated herein. Client is solely responsible for the payment of such taxes, levies or duties.</p><h3>5.5 Changing Plans.</h3><p>Any Client has the right to upgrade or downgrade a current Plan at any time by selecting a new Plan among the collection of Plans determined by Nous Research. In such an event, the Client&#x27;s credit card on file with Nous Research will automatically be charged with a Fee for the next payment interval with the rate stipulated in the new Plan.</p><p>Downgrading of the current Plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of the Account, as well as the loss of Client Data.</p><h3>5.6 Free Trial.</h3><p>A new Client may be entitled to a Free Trial, unless the Client has applied for the Account as a result of an ongoing marketing campaign organized by Nous Research in co-operation with its partners. The Client is not required to provide any credit card information during the period of Free Trial. If the period of Free Trial has expired, the Account will be automatically deactivated. In order to prevent deactivation or to reactivate the Account, the Client is required to select a suitable Plan and pay the first Fee. If the Client does not pay the first Fee within 2 weeks as of the expiry of the Free Trial, Nous Research has the right to permanently delete the Account, including all Client Data therein.</p><p>In addition to the current collection of Plans, Nous Research may offer special discounts and motivation schemes (for example finder&#x27;s fees, etc.).</p></section><section><h2>6. Payment</h2><p>The following provisions are applicable only if you purchase access to the Nous Research Services directly from Nous Research.</p><h3>6.1 Payment Card Authorization.</h3><p>Nous Research may seek pre-authorization of Client&#x27;s payment card account prior to your purchase of Nous Research Services in order to verify that the card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. You authorize such payment card account to pay any amounts described herein, and authorize Nous Research to charge all sums described in these Terms to such card account. You agree to provide Nous Research updated information regarding your payment card account upon Nous Research&#x27;s request and any time the information earlier provided is no longer valid.</p><h3>6.2 Direct Debit Payments.</h3><p>In some markets Nous Research may, if Client elects, request that Client complete a direct debit mandate to enable direct debit payments. In such cases Nous Research shall comply with all applicable national rules and regulations related to direct debit payments.</p><h3>6.3 Electronic Invoice.</h3><p>If Nous Research has not sought pre-authorization of your payment card, then before the end of each payment interval, Client will be issued an electronic invoice for payment of the Fee of the next payment interval. Client must pay the invoice by the due date indicated on the invoice.</p><h3>6.4 Overage Charges.</h3><p>Upon delay with any payments, Nous Research may require the Client to pay interest on the delay (penalty for late payment) for the period as of the time the payment obligation falls due until conforming performance is rendered. The interest rate of penalty for late payment due shall be 1% per month; provided, however, if any interest paid to Nous Research is determined to be in excess of the then legal maximum rate, then that portion of each interest payment representing an amount in excess of the then legal maximum rate shall be deemed a payment of amounts owing under Section 6.2. Upon calculation of the penalty for late payment, one year shall be deemed to contain 365 calendar days.</p></section><section><h2>7. Client Data</h2><h3>7.1 Uploading Client Data to Platform.</h3><p>If the Client uploads Client Data to the Platform, such Client Data and any processing of such Client Data must be in compliance with these Terms and applicable law.

You understand that all information contained in Client Data is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Client Data originated. This means that Client, and not Nous Research, is entirely responsible for all Client Data that is uploaded, posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Nous Research Services, as well as for any actions taken by Nous Research or other Clients or Users as a result of such Client Data.</p><h3>7.3 Unlawful Client Data.</h3><p>Nous Research is not obliged to pre-screen, monitor or filter any Client Data or acts of its processing by the Client in order to discover any unlawful nature therein. However, if such unlawful Client Data or the action of its unlawful processing is discovered or brought to the attention of Nous Research or if there is reason to believe that certain Client Data is unlawful, Nous Research has the right to:</p><ol><li>notify the Client of such unlawful Client Data;</li><li>deny its publication on the Web Site or its insertion to the System;</li><li>demand that the Client bring the unlawful Client Data into compliance with these Terms and applicable law;</li><li>temporarily or permanently remove the unlawful Client Data from the Web Site or Account, restrict access to it or delete it.</li></ol><p>If Nous Research is presented convincing evidence that the Client Data is not unlawful, Nous Research may, at its sole discretion, restore such Client Data, which was removed from the Web Site or Account or access to which was restricted.</p><p>In addition, in the event Nous Research believes in its sole discretion Client Data violates applicable laws, rules or regulations or these Terms, Nous Research may (but has no obligation), to remove such Client Data at any time with or without notice.</p><p>Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Nous Research complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and will remove Client Data from the Platform upon receipt of a compliant takedown notice.</p><h3>7.4 Compelled Disclosure.</h3><p>Nous Research may disclose a Client&#x27;s confidential information to the extent compelled by law to do so. In such instance, Nous Research will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Client with prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and Client shall provide reasonable assistance, at its cost, if Client wishes to contest the disclosure. If Nous Research is compelled by law to disclose Client&#x27;s confidential information as part of a civil proceeding to which Nous Research is a party, and Client is not contesting the disclosure, Client will reimburse Nous Research for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that confidential information.</p></section><section><h2>8.

Our Responsibilities</h2><h3>4.1. Provision of Nous Research Services.</h3><p>Nous Research will (a) make the Nous Research Services, Content and Client Data available to a Client pursuant to these Terms, (b) provide applicable standard support for the Nous Research Services to Client at no additional charge, and/or upgraded support (for an additional charge, if applicable), (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Nous Research Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for: (i) planned downtime (of which Nous Research shall give advance electronic notice as provided in the Guidelines), and (ii) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Nous Research&#x27;s reasonable control, including, for example, an act of God, act of government, flood, fire, earthquake, civil unrest, act of terror, strike or other labor problem, Internet service provider failure or delay, or denial of service attack.</p><h3>4.2. Protection of Client Data.</h3><p>Nous Research will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Client Data, as described in the Guidelines. Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures for preventing access, use, modification or disclosure of Client Data by Nous Research personnel except (a) to provide the Nous Research Services and prevent or address service or technical problems, (b) as compelled by law in accordance with Section 7.4 (Compelled Disclosure) below, or (c) as a Client or User expressly permit in writing.</p></section><section><h2>5. Using the Nous Research Services</h2><h3>5.1 Establishing an Account.</h3><p>Certain features, functions, parts or elements of the Nous Research Services can be used or accessed only by holders of an Account. The person who wishes to create an Account must:</p><ol><li>complete the sign-up form on the Web Site; and</li><li>accept these Terms by clicking “Sign up” or other similar button</li></ol><p>Each Client may have only one Account. If several persons need to use an Account on behalf of Client, Client must designate such persons as Users. Each such User shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p><p>If Client has designated Users and granted them Authorization, such Users will be deemed to be authorized to act on behalf of Client when using the Account. Nous Research is not responsible for and shall have no liability for verifying the validity of Authorization of any User. However, Nous Research may, in its discretion, request additional information or proof of the person&#x27;s credentials. If Nous Research is not certain if a User has been granted Authorization, Nous Research may, in its sole discretion, prevent such User from accessing the Nous Research Services.</p><p>A User may be associated with multiple Clients and Accounts. Deleting a User from one Account will not remove the User from the Platform if he/she is connected to multiple Accounts.</p><p>The Client and any User associated with an Account must provide Nous Research with true, accurate, current, and complete information about the Client, Users or Account and keep it up to date.</p><h3>5.2 Logging Into an Account.</h3><p>Nous Research shall provide Client with a username and password (“Login Credentials”) to be used to log in to its Account unless the Client uses the single sign-on feature or another service to log in. These Login Credentials must not be used by multiple persons. If Client has designated several Users, each User will be provided with separate Login Credentials. Client and each User are responsible for keeping confidential all login credentials associated with an Account. Client must promptly notify Nous Research:</p><ol><li>of any disclosure, loss or unauthorized use of any Login Credentials;</li><li>of a User&#x27;s departure from the Client&#x27;s organization;</li><li>of a change in a User&#x27;s role in the Client&#x27;s organization;</li><li>of any termination of a User&#x27;s right for any reason.</li></ol><h3>5.3 Termination of Account.</h3><p>Client may terminate these Terms at any time as provided in Section 17. Nous Research shall permanently delete the Account within six months of the effective date of the termination.</p><h3>5.4 Fees.</h3><p>The use of an Account is subject to a Fee. Upon sign-up for an Account, the Client must select a Plan. Different rates apply to different Plans. The applicable Fee is charged in advance on monthly or annual payment intervals, unless agreed otherwise between parties. All Fees are non-refundable, i.e. there are no refunds or credits for periods where the Client did not use an activated Account, used it only partially, or deactivated the Account or terminated these Terms during an ongoing payment interval. If, after signing up, Client elects to upgrade to a more expensive Plan, the unused portion of any prepaid Fees shall be applied to the Fee of the more expensive Plan.</p><p>All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies or duties applicable under any applicable law, unless stated otherwise stated herein. Client is solely responsible for the payment of such taxes, levies or duties.</p><h3>5.5 Changing Plans.</h3><p>Any Client has the right to upgrade or downgrade a current Plan at any time by selecting a new Plan among the collection of Plans determined by Nous Research. In such an event, the Client&#x27;s credit card on file with Nous Research will automatically be charged with a Fee for the next payment interval with the rate stipulated in the new Plan.</p><p>Downgrading of the current Plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of the Account, as well as the loss of Client Data.</p><h3>5.6 Free Trial.</h3><p>A new Client may be entitled to a Free Trial, unless the Client has applied for the Account as a result of an ongoing marketing campaign organized by Nous Research in co-operation with its partners. The Client is not required to provide any credit card information during the period of Free Trial. If the period of Free Trial has expired, the Account will be automatically deactivated. In order to prevent deactivation or to reactivate the Account, the Client is required to select a suitable Plan and pay the first Fee. If the Client does not pay the first Fee within 2 weeks as of the expiry of the Free Trial, Nous Research has the right to permanently delete the Account, including all Client Data therein.</p><p>In addition to the current collection of Plans, Nous Research may offer special discounts and motivation schemes (for example finder&#x27;s fees, etc.).</p></section><section><h2>6. Payment</h2><p>The following provisions are applicable only if you purchase access to the Nous Research Services directly from Nous Research.</p><h3>6.1 Payment Card Authorization.</h3><p>Nous Research may seek pre-authorization of Client&#x27;s payment card account prior to your purchase of Nous Research Services in order to verify that the card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. You authorize such payment card account to pay any amounts described herein, and authorize Nous Research to charge all sums described in these Terms to such card account. You agree to provide Nous Research updated information regarding your payment card account upon Nous Research&#x27;s request and any time the information earlier provided is no longer valid.</p><h3>6.2 Direct Debit Payments.</h3><p>In some markets Nous Research may, if Client elects, request that Client complete a direct debit mandate to enable direct debit payments. In such cases Nous Research shall comply with all applicable national rules and regulations related to direct debit payments.</p><h3>6.3 Electronic Invoice.</h3><p>If Nous Research has not sought pre-authorization of your payment card, then before the end of each payment interval, Client will be issued an electronic invoice for payment of the Fee of the next payment interval. Client must pay the invoice by the due date indicated on the invoice.</p><h3>6.4 Overage Charges.</h3><p>Upon delay with any payments, Nous Research may require the Client to pay interest on the delay (penalty for late payment) for the period as of the time the payment obligation falls due until conforming performance is rendered. The interest rate of penalty for late payment due shall be 1% per month; provided, however, if any interest paid to Nous Research is determined to be in excess of the then legal maximum rate, then that portion of each interest payment representing an amount in excess of the then legal maximum rate shall be deemed a payment of amounts owing under Section 6.2. Upon calculation of the penalty for late payment, one year shall be deemed to contain 365 calendar days.</p></section><section><h2>7. Client Data</h2><h3>7.1 Uploading Client Data to Platform.</h3><p>If the Client uploads Client Data to the Platform, such Client Data and any processing of such Client Data must be in compliance with these Terms and applicable law. All rights, title and interest in and to the Client Data belong to the Client or third persons (including Users, persons and Organizations) whether posted and/or uploaded by you or made available on or through the Nous Research Services by Nous Research. By uploading Client Data to the Platform, Client authorizes Nous Research to process the Client Data. The Client is responsible for ensuring that:</p><ol><li>the Client and any of the Users associated with the Account do not create, transmit, display or make otherwise available any Client Data that violates the terms of these Terms, the rights of Nous Research, other Clients or Users, persons or Organizations or is harmful (for example viruses, worms, malware and other destructive codes), offensive, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of another&#x27;s privacy, hateful or otherwise unlawful; and</li><li>the Client and all of the Users associated with the Account have the necessary rights to use the Client Data, including to insert it into the Platform and process it by means of the Account.</li></ol><h3>7.2 No Guarantee of Accuracy.</h3><p>Nous Research does not guarantee any accuracy with respect to any information contained in any Client Data, and strongly recommends that you think carefully about what you transmit, submit or post to or through the Nous Research Services. You understand that all information contained in Client Data is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Client Data originated. This means that Client, and not Nous Research, is entirely responsible for all Client Data that is uploaded, posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Nous Research Services, as well as for any actions taken by Nous Research or other Clients or Users as a result of such Client Data.</p><h3>7.3 Unlawful Client Data.</h3><p>Nous Research is not obliged to pre-screen, monitor or filter any Client Data or acts of its processing by the Client in order to discover any unlawful nature therein. However, if such unlawful Client Data or the action of its unlawful processing is discovered or brought to the attention of Nous Research or if there is reason to believe that certain Client Data is unlawful, Nous Research has the right to:</p><ol><li>notify the Client of such unlawful Client Data;</li><li>deny its publication on the Web Site or its insertion to the System;</li><li>demand that the Client bring the unlawful Client Data into compliance with these Terms and applicable law;</li><li>temporarily or permanently remove the unlawful Client Data from the Web Site or Account, restrict access to it or delete it.</li></ol><p>If Nous Research is presented convincing evidence that the Client Data is not unlawful, Nous Research may, at its sole discretion, restore such Client Data, which was removed from the Web Site or Account or access to which was restricted.</p><p>In addition, in the event Nous Research believes in its sole discretion Client Data violates applicable laws, rules or regulations or these Terms, Nous Research may (but has no obligation), to remove such Client Data at any time with or without notice.</p><p>Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Nous Research complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and will remove Client Data from the Platform upon receipt of a compliant takedown notice.</p><h3>7.4 Compelled Disclosure.</h3><p>Nous Research may disclose a Client&#x27;s confidential information to the extent compelled by law to do so. In such instance, Nous Research will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Client with prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and Client shall provide reasonable assistance, at its cost, if Client wishes to contest the disclosure. If Nous Research is compelled by law to disclose Client&#x27;s confidential information as part of a civil proceeding to which Nous Research is a party, and Client is not contesting the disclosure, Client will reimburse Nous Research for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that confidential information.</p></section><section><h2>8.

Nous Research shall respond to enquiries of support from a Client utilizing the contacts set forth below as soon as reasonably possible.

Modifications, including change in applicable rates for the Nous Research Services, will become effective thirty (30) days before the effective date of such modification.</p><p>If the Client does not accept the modification, the Client shall notify Nous Research before the effective date of the modification, and these Terms will terminate on the effective date of the modification. The Client&#x27;s continued use of the Nous Research Services, or any part or element thereof, after the effective date of a modification shall indicate its consent to the modifications.
