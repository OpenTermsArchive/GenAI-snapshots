Replicate hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable right to access and use the Services and Documentation solely for use in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in these Terms and on our Website. The Services are only available to Customers who can form legally binding contracts under Law.

              Among other benefits of our Services, you can access and run Models which are either private (proprietary to Customer or Replicate) or public open-sourced Models that may be found on platforms such as GitHub or Hugging Face as further set out on the Website (see our disclaimers in Section 7 regarding Models). You can create Customer Derivative Models or build and publish custom Models from scratch. For more information on how Models are built on Replicate, what tools we use, how you can deploy Models and other useful information for your use of our Services, please refer to our <a href="https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work">Website</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition to using the Models, Customers can obtain more control over how they run a Model by allowing deployments of a Model ("<strong>Deployments</strong>") on the Services which allow Customer to: roll out new versions of a Model without having to edit code; auto-scale Models to handle extra load and scale to zero when Models are not being used, saving cost; keep instances always on to avoid cold boots; customize what hardware the Models runs on; monitor whether instances are setting up, idle, or processing predictions; monitor the predictions that are flowing through the Model; and also limit the maximum number of instances the Deployment can use to limit Customer's maximum spend, or set a minimum to keep some instances warm and ready for predictions.

            You can sometimes try <a href="https://replicate.com/collections/try-for-free">a selection of models</a> out on Replicate for free, but some features are only available to customers with billing set up. See Section 4 for clauses related to fees.

We may in our sole discretion and at any time, modify Subscription fees for any subscriptions we offer for any part of our Service. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. Replicate will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. You may also receive access to certain features that we are trying out in beta. All Services are subject to our disclaimers. Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

Customer hereby authorizes Replicate (or its payment processor) to charge Customer's designated Payment Method for any amounts owed pursuant to this Agreement. We offer two billing models: (1) Payment in Arrears and (2) Prepaid Credit. Your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services will indicate which billing model applies to your use of the Services.

              <strong>Prepaid Credit Billing Model.</strong>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If your Account or other parts of the user interface of the Services specifies the Prepaid Credit billing model, Customer will be required to prepay an amount of its choosing ("<strong>Prepaid Balance</strong>") via the Payment Method in Customer's Account. The Prepaid Balance will be applied against fees incurred by Customer based on its actual usage of the Services. All fees for Customer's usage of the Services shall be debited from the Prepaid Balance as they accrue. Customer may view its current balance and usage in its Account.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Customer may elect to enable an auto-reload feature within its Account settings. If enabled, Customer may specify threshold and top-up parameters (e.g., "if balance falls below $100, reload to $150"), and Replicate is authorized to automatically charge Customer's designated Payment Method in accordance with such instructions. Customer remains responsible for ensuring that Payment Method information is accurate and up to date, and that sufficient funds are available for successful reloading. Replicate shall not be liable for any service disruption resulting from a failed auto-reload.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each payment to fund the Prepaid Balance will expire at the end of twelfth (12th) month after the date of payment if not fully used. Upon expiration, any unused amounts will be forfeited and will not be refunded or credited to Customer. It is Customer's responsibility to monitor its usage and ensure timely application of funds.
          </li>
          <li>
            If Customer's usage results in charges that exceed the Prepaid Balance (such excess, the "<strong>Overage</strong>"), such Overage shall be invoiced to Customer at the beginning of the following calendar month and shall be payable via the Payment Method on file. Replicate may charge Customer's Payment Method for any Overage at that time.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Prepaid Balance is depleted and Customer does not replenish it or fails to pay the Overage when due, Replicate reserves the right to suspend Customer's access to the Services, in whole or in part, without liability, until payment is received or the Prepaid Balance is restored.
          </li>
          <li>
            All Prepaid Balances are non-refundable, except as otherwise required by law or as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have certain billing policies to prevent fraudulent use of our Services. For instance, if your usage exceeds certain thresholds for the first time, or after you change your payment method, we may charge you prior to the month end for your usage in such month. Any early charges will show up as a credit on your invoice when it is issued.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Our billing practices may change from time to time. We will always update our Website in respect of any such change. For details on our billing practices for the use of Models, please review: <a href="https://replicate.com/docs/topics/billing#language-models">Billing</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Taxes. All Fees and other amounts payable by Customer are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer is responsible for all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Customer to Replicate, other than any taxes imposed on Replicate's income.
          </li>
          <li>
            Payment. Your payment is executed through third parties, such as Stripe. We do not store your Payment Method information. You are subject to Stripe's terms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Late Payment. If Customer fails to make any payment when due then, in addition to all other remedies that may be available, Replicate may charge interest on the past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under Law, and Customer shall reimburse Replicate for all reasonable costs incurred by Replicate in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys' fees, court costs, and collection agency fees, and if such failure continues for 30 days following written notice thereof, Replicate may suspend performance of the Services until all past due amounts and interest thereon have been paid, without incurring any obligation or liability to Customer or any other person by reason of such suspension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              No Deductions or Setoffs. All amounts payable to Replicate by Customer shall be paid in full without any setoff, recoupment, counterclaim, deduction, debit, or withholding for any reason.

              Indemnification Procedure. Customer shall promptly assume control of the defense of applicable Actions, and shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at Customer's sole cost and expense. Replicate may participate in and observe the proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing. Customer shall not settle any Action on any terms or in any manner that adversely affects the rights of a Replicate Indemnitee without such party's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Customer fails or refuses to assume control of the defense of such Action, Replicate Indemnitees shall have the right, but no obligation, to defend against such Action, including settling such Action after giving notice to Customer, in each case in such manner and on such terms as the Replicate Indemnitees may deem appropriate. The Replicate Indemnitee's failure to perform any obligations under this Section 9.2 will not relieve Customer of its obligations under this Section 9, except to the extent that the Customer can demonstrate that it has been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.
