Check out the <a href="/terms-of-service-teams">Teams Terms of Service</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Terms of Service: Individual &amp; Pro</strong></p><p><strong>Last updated February 24, 2025</strong></p><p>Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at Exafunction, Inc. ("<strong>Company</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice or our practices with regard to your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@codeium.com">hello@codeium.com</a>.</p><p><strong>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:</strong></p><p><strong>BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE</strong>, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING EXAFUNCTION’S <a href="/privacy-policy">PRIVACY POLICY</a> (TOGETHER, THESE “<strong>TERMS</strong>”). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND EXAFUNCTION’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY EXAFUNCTION AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p><p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE.</strong> Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section&nbsp;20, you agree that disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AND EXAFUNCTION ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p><p><strong>1. Exafunction Service Overview.</strong> Our Codeium platform offers a suite of coding tools driven by machine learning to help developers write code more easily and efficiently (the <strong>“Platform”</strong>) and can provide suggested code, outputs or other functions (each, a <strong>“Suggestion”</strong>). We also offer a limited version of the Platform through our website to anyone, with or without an account.</p><p><strong>2. Eligibility.</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p><p><strong>3. Accounts and Registration.</strong> To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and not misleading, and that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you should immediately notify us at <a href="mailto:hello@codeium.com">hello@codeium.com</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Beta or Trial Versions.</strong> Exafunction may from time to time offer trial or beta models or versions or features of the Service (each, a <strong>“Beta Service”</strong>). Exafunction will determine, at its sole discretion, the availability, duration (the <strong>“Trial Period”</strong>), features, and components of each Beta Service. ANY BETA SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, in no event will Exafunction be liable to you or any third party for any damages or liability related to, arising out of, or caused by any Beta Service and/or any modification, suspension, or termination thereof. If you qualify for a Beta Service and voluntarily agree to use a Beta Service, you agree to provide Exafunction Feedback (defined below) and respond to Exafunction’s questions or other inquiries regarding your use of the Beta Service, if requested. Exafunction has sole discretion in deciding whether or not to continue offering any Beta Service and may cease offering any Beta Service at any time. Upon completion of a Trial Period, you may lose access to the applicable Beta Service, unless or until the features of the Beta Service are incorporated into the Service. Any production candidate or non-production version of the Service will be considered a Beta Service. Except as expressly provided in this Section 4, these Terms govern your use of the Beta Service as part of the Service.</p><p><strong>5. General Payment Terms.</strong> We offer a paid version of this Individual license, which includes enhanced features. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as required by law. The pricing and payment terms in this Section 5 are subject to any pricing and payment terms set forth in an Order Form.</p><p>5.1. <strong>Price.</strong> Exafunction reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Exafunction will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. Exafunction may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Exafunction gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Exafunction, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Exafunction’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p><p>5.2. <strong>Authorization.</strong> You authorize Exafunction to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Exafunction, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, then Exafunction may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p><p>5.3. <strong>Subscription Service.</strong> The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“<strong>Subscription Service</strong>”). The “<strong>Subscription Billing Date</strong>” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your account (such period, the “<strong>Initial Subscription Period</strong>”), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a “<strong>Subscription Period</strong>”) unless you cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Exafunction or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. For information on the “<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>”, please see our pricing page. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Exafunction or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by using the cancellation functionality made available in your billing menu or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hello@codeium.com">hello@codeium.com</a>. YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGE FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.</p><p>5.4. <strong>Delinquent Accounts.</strong> Exafunction may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal Subscription Fee is due, then Exafunction reserves the right to delete your account and any information associated with your account without any liability to you.</p><p><strong>6. Licenses</strong></p><p>6.1. <strong>Limited License.</strong> Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, and the payment of the applicable Fee (for Pro Users), Exafunction grants you, solely for your personal use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to: (a) install and use one object code copy of any downloadable application that we provide to you, on a device that you own or control; and (b) access and use the Service.</p><p>6.2. <strong>License Restrictions.</strong> Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not: (a) reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or create derivative works of the Service; (b) make modifications to the Service; or (c) interfere with or circumvent any feature of the Service, including any security or access control mechanism. If you are prohibited under applicable law from using the Service, then you may not use it.</p><p>6.3. <strong>Feedback.</strong> We respect and appreciate the thoughts and comments from our users. If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding existing functionalities, problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the Service (<strong>“Feedback”</strong>), then you hereby grant Exafunction an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right and license to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the Service and create other products and services. We will have no obligation to provide you with attribution for any Feedback you provide to us.</p><p><strong>7. Ownership; Proprietary Rights.</strong> The Service is owned and operated by Exafunction. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service provided by Exafunction (<strong>“Materials”</strong>) are protected by intellectual property and other laws. All Materials included in the Service are the property of Exafunction or its third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by Exafunction, you may not make use of the Materials.

Third-Party Terms</strong></p><p>8.1. <strong>Third-Party Services and Linked Websites.</strong> Exafunction may provide tools through the Service that enable you to export information, including User Content, to third-party services. By using one of these tools, you hereby authorize Exafunction to transfer that information to the applicable third-party service. Third-party services are not under Exafunction’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Exafunction is not responsible for any third-party service’s use of your exported information. The Service may also contain links to third-party websites. Linked websites are not under Exafunction’s control, and Exafunction is not responsible for their content. Please be sure to review the terms of use and privacy policy of any third-party services before you share any User Content or information with such third-party services. Once sharing occurs, Exafunction will have no control over the information that has been shared.</p><p>8.2. <strong>Third-Party Platforms.</strong> Platforms.&nbsp;You may elect to use or integrate platforms, add-ons, services, or products not provided by Exafunction (“Third-Party Platforms”) (e.g. User IDE’s, Web Search, MCP Servers) subject to your agreement with the relevant provider and not this Agreement. We do not control nor shall we have liability for such integrations, including their security, functionality, operation, availability, or interoperability with the Service or how they or their providers use Customer Data. By enabling a Third-Party Platform to interact with the Service, you permit the Service to exchange Customer Data with such Third-Party Platform.</p><p><strong>9. User Content</strong></p><p>9.1. <strong>User Content Generally.</strong> Certain features of the Service may permit users to submit, upload, publish, broadcast, or otherwise transmit (<strong>“Post”</strong>) content to the Service, including folders, data, text, and any other works of authorship or other works (<strong>“User Content”</strong>). You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you Post to the Service, subject to the licenses granted in these Terms.</p><p>9.2. <strong>Use of User Content.</strong> By Posting User Content to or via the Service, you authorize us to use it to provide the Service and Suggestions to you.</p><p>9.3. <strong>You Must Have Rights to the Content You Post; User Content Representations and Warranties.</strong> You must not Post User Content if you are not the owner of or are not fully authorized to grant rights in all of the elements of that User Content. Exafunction disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing User Content via the Service. By providing User Content via the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant to us that:</p><p>(a) you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Exafunction and users of the Service to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by Exafunction, the Service, and these Terms;</p><p>(b) your User Content, and the Posting or other use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, misappropriate, or otherwise breach any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property, contract, or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Exafunction to violate any law or regulation or require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and</p><p>(c) your User Content could not be deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.</p><p>9.4. <strong>User Content Disclaimer.</strong> We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users Post and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. Exafunction may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms, is alleged to violate the rights of third parties, or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that, when using the Service, you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Exafunction with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, Exafunction does not permit infringing activities on the Service.</p><p>9.5. <strong>Monitoring Content.</strong> Exafunction does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User Content; (b) any content made available by third parties; or (c) the use of the Service by its users. You acknowledge and agree that Exafunction reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Service.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR EXAFUNCTION ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING SUGGESTIONS, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE EXAFUNCTION ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.</p><p>18.3. THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION&nbsp;18 APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Exafunction does not disclaim any warranty or other right that Exafunction is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.</p><p><strong>19. Limitation of Liability</strong></p><p>19.1. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE EXAFUNCTION ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING SUGGESTIONS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY EXAFUNCTION ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.</p><p>19.2.

THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION&nbsp;19 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p><p><strong>20. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong></p><p>20.1. <strong>Generally.</strong> Except as described in Section&nbsp;20.2 and 20.3, you and Exafunction agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p><p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND EXAFUNCTION ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p><p>20.2. <strong>Exceptions.</strong> Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p><p>20.3. <strong>Opt-Out.</strong> If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;20 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Exafunction, Inc., Attention: Arbitration Opt-Out, 900 Villa Street, Mountain View, CA 94041 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (<strong>“Opt-Out Notice”</strong>). Once Exafunction receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section&nbsp;20 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section&nbsp;21.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</p><p>20.4. <strong>Arbitrator.</strong> This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes (collectively, <strong>“JAMS Rules”</strong>) as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.org">www.jamsadr.org</a>, by calling the JAMS at +1-800-352-5267 or by contacting Exafunction.</p><p>20.5. <strong>Commencing Arbitration.</strong> Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (<strong>“Notice of Arbitration”</strong>). Exafunction’s address for Notice is: Exafunction, Inc., 900 Villa Street, Mountain View, CA 94041. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a)&nbsp;identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (<strong>“Demand”</strong>). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Exafunction may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Exafunction will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if the Company has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.</p><p>20.6. <strong>Arbitration Proceedings.</strong> Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence or business address (as applicable) unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence or business address (as applicable). During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Exafunction must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p><p>20.7. <strong>Arbitration Relief.</strong> Except as provided in Section 20.8, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brough in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Exafunction before an arbitrator was selected, Exafunction will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b)&nbsp;US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p>20.8. <strong>No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND EXAFUNCTION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Exafunction agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p><p>20.9. <strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong> If Exafunction makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30&nbsp;days of the change to Exafunction’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Exafunction will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p><p>20.10. <strong>Enforceability.</strong> If Section&nbsp;20.8 or the entirety of this Section&nbsp;20 is found to be unenforceable, or if Exafunction receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section&nbsp;20 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section&nbsp;21.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p><p><strong>21. Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>21.1. <strong>General Terms.</strong> These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Exafunction regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms and all rights granted under these Terms, including with respect to your User Content, at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section&nbsp;headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p><p>21.2. <strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Exafunction submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We operate the Service from our offices in California, and we make no representation that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p><p>21.3. <strong>Privacy Policy.</strong> Please read the Exafunction <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> (the <strong>“Privacy Policy”</strong>) carefully for information relating to our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your personal information.
