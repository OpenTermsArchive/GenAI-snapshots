Exafunction will determine, at its sole discretion, the availability, duration (the <strong>“Trial Period”</strong>), features, and components of each Beta Service. ANY BETA SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, in no event will Exafunction be liable to you or any third party for any damages or liability related to, arising out of, or caused by any Beta Service and/or any modification, suspension, or termination thereof. If you qualify for a Beta Service and voluntarily agree to use a Beta Service, you agree to provide Exafunction Feedback (defined below) and respond to Exafunction’s questions or other inquiries regarding your use of the Beta Service, if requested. Exafunction has sole discretion in deciding whether or not to continue offering any Beta Service and may cease offering any Beta Service at any time. Upon completion of a Trial Period, you may lose access to the applicable Beta Service, unless or until the features of the Beta Service are incorporated into the Service. Any production candidate or non-production version of the Service will be considered a Beta Service. Except as expressly provided in this Section 4, these Terms govern your use of the Beta Service as part of the Service.</p><p><strong>5. General Payment Terms.</strong> We offer a paid version of this Individual license, which includes enhanced features. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. In some cases, you may pre-authorize incremental purchases based on usage. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as required by law. The pricing and payment terms in this Section 5 are subject to any pricing and payment terms set forth in an Order Form.</p><p>5.1. <strong>Price.</strong> Exafunction reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Exafunction will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. Exafunction may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Exafunction gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Exafunction, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Exafunction’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p><p>5.2. <strong>Authorization.</strong> You authorize Exafunction to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Exafunction, including all applicable taxes, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, then Exafunction may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p><p>5.3. <strong>Subscription Service.</strong> The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“<strong>Subscription Service</strong>”). The “<strong>Subscription Billing Date</strong>” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your account (such period, the “<strong>Initial Subscription Period</strong>”), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a “<strong>Subscription Period</strong>”) unless you cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Exafunction or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. For information on the “<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>”, please see our pricing page. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Exafunction or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by using the cancellation functionality made available in your billing menu. YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGE FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.</p><p>5.4. <strong>Delinquent Accounts.</strong> Exafunction may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal Subscription Fee is due, then Exafunction reserves the right to delete your account and any information associated with your account without any liability to you.</p><p><strong>6.

Use of User Content to Improve Services</strong></p><p>10.1 <strong>Use of Autocomplete User Content to Improve Services.</strong> We may use your Autocomplete User Content to improve our discriminative machine learning models, which are models that rank or assign scores to code generations in order to understand the boundaries between different sets of code. We will never use your Autocomplete User Content to improve generative machine learning models, which are models that are able to generate code directly based on studying existing code generations, for Autocomplete or other services. Any Autocomplete User Content used for training our discriminative machine learning models is anonymized, such that any personally identifiable information is removed. To opt out of having your Autocomplete User Content used for such purpose, you may change the code sharing options in the User Settings pane of the user's profile page. Please note that if you opt out, your Autocomplete User Content will be sent to our servers so that we are able to provide you with the Services, but we will not retain your Autocomplete User Content on our servers for training our discriminative machine learning models. “Autocomplete User Content” mean User Content provided to the Service in the operation of the Autocomplete feature.</p><p>10.2 <strong>Use of Chat User Content to Improve Services.</strong> We may use your Chat User Content to improve the generative and discriminative machine learning models we use.

Exafunction will not disclose Usage Data externally, including in benchmarks or reports, unless such Usage Data has been (a) de-identified so that it does not individually identify you or any other person and (b) aggregated with usage data from other users of the Platform. <strong>"Usage Data"</strong> means any performance, analytical, or usage data or information relating to access to or use of the Service that is generated or otherwise collected by the Service but excluding User Content. For Pro Users, you may elect to place limits on the use of User Content such that User Content (i) is transmitted only to generate code, outputs, or other functions generated in response to input User Content ("Suggestions") in real-time and are deleted once Suggestions are generated; (ii) is not used for any other purpose, including the training of language models; and (iii) is encrypted during transit and is not stored at rest.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong></p><p>20.1. <strong>Generally.</strong> Except as described in Section&nbsp;20.2 and 20.3, you and Exafunction agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p><p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND EXAFUNCTION ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p><p>20.2. <strong>Exceptions.</strong> Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p><p>20.3. <strong>Opt-Out.</strong> If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;20 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Exafunction, Inc., Attention: Arbitration Opt-Out, 900 Villa Street, Mountain View, CA 94041 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (<strong>“Opt-Out Notice”</strong>). Once Exafunction receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section&nbsp;20 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section&nbsp;21.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</p><p>20.4. <strong>Arbitrator.</strong> This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes (collectively, <strong>“JAMS Rules”</strong>) as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.org">www.jamsadr.org</a>, by calling the JAMS at +1-800-352-5267 or by contacting Exafunction.</p><p>20.5. <strong>Commencing Arbitration.</strong> Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (<strong>“Notice of Arbitration”</strong>). Exafunction’s address for Notice is: Exafunction, Inc., 900 Villa Street, Mountain View, CA 94041. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a)&nbsp;identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (<strong>“Demand”</strong>). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Exafunction may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Exafunction will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if the Company has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to JAMS.</p><p>20.6. <strong>Arbitration Proceedings.</strong> Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your residence or business address (as applicable) unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence or business address (as applicable). During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Exafunction must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p><p>20.7. <strong>Arbitration Relief.</strong> Except as provided in Section 20.8, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brough in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Exafunction before an arbitrator was selected, Exafunction will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b)&nbsp;US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p><p>20.8. <strong>No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND EXAFUNCTION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Exafunction agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p><p>20.9. <strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong> If Exafunction makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30&nbsp;days of the change to Exafunction’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Exafunction will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p><p>20.10. <strong>Enforceability.</strong> If Section&nbsp;20.8 or the entirety of this Section&nbsp;20 is found to be unenforceable, or if Exafunction receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section&nbsp;20 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section&nbsp;21.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p><p><strong>21. Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>21.1. <strong>General Terms.</strong> These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Exafunction regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms and all rights granted under these Terms, including with respect to your User Content, at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of Section&nbsp;headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to.” If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p><p>21.2. <strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Exafunction submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. We operate the Service from our offices in California, and we make no representation that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p><p>21.3. <strong>Privacy Policy.</strong> Please read the Exafunction <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> (the <strong>“Privacy Policy”</strong>) carefully for information relating to our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your personal information.
