        any rights of Company or any third party. In addition, Company will use
        the AI Features only in accordance with these Terms and any
        Documentation directed to the AI Features. Due to the nature of the AI
        Features, Output Content may not be unique across users, and the AI
        Features may generate different, the same, or similar Output Content for

      <li>Fees and Payment Terms</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pricing for the Services may be based on compute time (e.g., number of
        inference steps) or by model output (e.g., by size of generated images,
        per image, or per video), as described on the Sites. To utilize the
        Services, Customer will be required to purchase credits in advance. Each
        time you use the Services (whether through the user interface or through
        an API call) the cost for such use will be deducted from your credit
        balance. You are solely responsible for maintaining a sufficient credit
        balance to use the Services. If you do not have enough credits to cover
        your use of the Services, you will be required to purchase additional
        credits. Credits will expire 365 days from the date of purchase. If you
        receive free or other promotional credits, they expire in 90 days. Once
        purchased, these credits can be used only for the consumption of
        Services and are non-refundable (except as otherwise expressly provided
        in these Terms or otherwise agreed to by Company in its sole
        discretion), non-transferable, and cannot be exchanged for currency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prices shown on the Sites exclude all taxes. All prices on the Sites are

      </li>
      <li>
        Customer may use a payment card or Automated Clearing House (ACH) to pay
        for credits in U.S. Dollars. Customer and Company will enter into the
        necessary payment authorizations forms to enable payments by Customer
        via ACH. Company offers use of a payment card as a convenience to its
        customers and uses a third-party payment processor to process payment
        transactions on its behalf. By enabling payment by payment card,
        Customer (i) agrees to be bound by the separate terms and conditions
        applicable to the third-party payment processing services; (ii)
        authorizes Company to have the payment processor charge or debit the
        payment card provided by Customer in the amount of the credits
        purchased; and (iii) will pay for all associated payment processing
        fees. We may receive updated information from your issuing bank or our
        payment service provider about any payment method you have used.
        Customer acknowledges and agrees that all Customer information submitted
        in connection with its payment card is separately collected, processed,
        and stored by the payment processor and is subject to the payment
        processor's posted privacy policy. Company will not be responsible for
        and will have no liability in respect of any services provided by the
        payment processor.

        Company determines that Customer is using the Services in violation of
        applicable law, breach of Sections 6(d), 6(e), or Section 7, or in
        connection with any fraudulent activity; (ii) if Company reasonably
        determines that Customer's use of the Services adversely affects or
        interferes with the normal operation of the Services, or any service to
        others in a material manner; (iii) if Company is prohibited by an order
        of a court or other governmental agency from providing the Services;
        (iv) for Customer's non-payment of any fees due and payable within 10
        days of demand by Company; or (v) if Company reasonably believes there
        exists any malicious code or a security incident that threatens the
        security of the Services or Customer Input. Company will use
        commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer before such
        suspension, but Company reserves the right to exercise its suspension
        rights without prior notice if it reasonably determines it is required
        to protect its interests in, or the integrity or security of, the
        Services. Company will have no liability for any damages, liabilities,
        or losses as a result of any suspension or limitation of Customer's use
        of the Services in accordance with this paragraph.

        liability-whether based in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, or
        otherwise-for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, or

      <li>
        The total liability of Company and the other Company Parties for any

        The limitations set forth in this Section 16 will not limit or exclude
        liability for the gross negligence, fraud, or intentional misconduct of

        liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
        Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or

      <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND COMPANY
        TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH
        YOU AND COMPANY CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM EACH OTHER. ARBITRATION PRECLUDES
        YOU AND COMPANY FROM SUING IN COURT OR HAVING A JURY TRIAL. YOU AND
        COMPANY AGREE THAT ARBITRATION WILL BE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
        NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION, OR ANY OTHER KIND OF
        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. COMPANY AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO
        TRIAL BY A JURY.</strong>
    </p>

      <strong>THE PARTIES TO THESE TERMS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION
        ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLVING
        THEIR DISPUTES AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO DELAY ADJUDICATION OF ANY PARTY'S
        CLAIMS.</strong>

    <p>

      <li>
        <a><strong>Claims To Which This Section Applies.</strong> The dispute
          resolution and binding arbitration terms in this Section 18 apply to
          all Claims between you and Company. For purposes of this Section 18
          only, a "<strong>Claim</strong>" is any dispute, claim, or controversy
          (excluding those exceptions listed below) between you and Company,
          whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or
          any other legal theory, that either party wishes to seek legal
          recourse for and that arises from or relates to these Terms or the
          Services, including any privacy or data-security claims or claims
          related to the validity, enforceability, or scope of the arbitration
          requirement or any portion of it.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration</strong>. If
        you have a Claim against Company or if Company has a Claim against you,
        you and Company will first attempt to resolve the Claim informally in
        order to try and resolve the Claim faster and reduce costs for both
        parties. You and Company will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the
        resolution of any Claim for 30 days, or such longer period as mutually
        agreed in writing (email suffices) by the parties, ("<strong>Informal Resolution Period</strong>") from the day either party receives a written notice of a dispute
        from the other party (a "<strong>Claimant Notice</strong>") in
        accordance with these Terms.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You will send any Claimant Notice to Company by certified mail addressed
      to fal - Features &amp; Labels Inc., 2261 Market St. Suite 10467, San
      Francisco, CA 94114 or by email to
      <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>. Company will
      send any Claimant Notice to you by certified mail or email using the
      contact information you have provided to Company. The Claimant Notice sent
      by either party must (i) include the sender's name, address, email
      address, and telephone number; (ii) describe the nature and basis of the
      Claim; and (iii) set forth the specific relief sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Informal Resolution Period is designed to allow the party who has
      received a Claimant Notice to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement
      if it chooses to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      You or Company can file a Claim in arbitration only after the end of the
      Informal Resolution Period. You or Company cannot proceed to arbitration
      before the end of the Informal Resolution Period. If you or Company file a
      Claim in court or proceed to arbitration without complying with the
      requirements in Section 18, including waiting until the conclusion of the
      Informal Resolution Period, the other party reserves the right to seek
      relief from a court to enjoin the filing and seek damages from the party
      that has not followed the requirements in this Section to reimburse it for
      any arbitration fees and costs already incurred as a foreseeable
      consequence of that breach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines for a Claim will
      be tolled for the duration of the Informal Resolution Period for that
      Claim so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution
      process.

      <li>
        <strong>Claims Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions.</strong>
        Except for individual disputes that qualify for small claims court
        (provided that the small-claims court does not permit class or similar
        representative actions or relief) and any disputes exclusively related
        to the intellectual property or intellectual-property rights of you or
        Company, including any disputes in which you or Company seek injunctive
        or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of your or
        Company's intellectual property or other infringement of your or
        Company's intellectual property rights("<strong>IP Claims</strong>"),
        all Claims, including Claims that are not related to intellectual
        property or intellectual-property rights but are jointly filed with IP
        Claims, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 18(b) will be
        resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration
        instead of in a court by a judge or jury. Such Claims include disputes
        arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this
        arbitration provision, including the enforceability, revocability, or
        validity of the arbitration provision or any portion of the arbitration
        provision. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant any remedy or
        relief that would otherwise be available in court.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Binding Individual Arbitration</strong>. Subject to the terms of
        this section, Claims may only be settled by binding individual
        arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the
        "<strong>AAA</strong>"), https://adr.org/, according to the Federal
        Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., ("<strong>FAA</strong>"). For
        Claims arbitrated by the AAA, if you are a "<strong>Consumer</strong>,"
        meaning that you only use the Services for personal, family, or
        household purposes, the then-current version of the AAA's Consumer
        Arbitration Rules are the rules applicable to Claims between you and
        Company as modified by these Terms (the "<strong>Rules</strong>"). For
        Claims arbitrated by the AAA, if you are not a Consumer, the
        then-current version of the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and
        Mediation Procedures are the Rules applicable to Claims between you and
        Company as modified by these Terms.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These Terms affect interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this
      Section 18 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA to
      the extent permitted by law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the
      Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural
      and substantive decisions regarding any Claim and to grant any remedy that
      would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine
      the question of arbitrability. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable
      law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are
      individual to you or Company to satisfy one of our individual Claims (that
      the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). To
      the extent that you prevail on a Claim and seek public injunctive relief
      (that is, injunctive relief whose primary purpose and effect is to
      prohibit and enjoin conduct harmful to the general public), the
      entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil
      court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
      that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed
      pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in arbitration.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Arbitration Procedure and Location</strong>. You or Company may
        initiate arbitration of any Claim not resolved during the Informal
        Resolution Period by filing a demand for arbitration with AAA in
        accordance with the Rules.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Instructions for filing a demand for with AAA are available on the AAA
      website or by calling AAA at 800-778-7879. You will send a copy of any
      demand for arbitration to Company by certified mail addressed to fal -
      Features &amp; Labels Inc., 2261 Market St. Suite 10467, San Francisco, CA
      94114 or by email to
      <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">[email protected]</a>. Company will
      send any demand for arbitration to you by certified mail or email using
      the contact information you have provided to Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in the English
      language. You and Company both agree that the arbitrator will be bound by
      these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Claims in which the claimant seeks less than USD $10,000, the
      arbitrator will decide the matter solely based on written submissions,
      without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal
      hearing is necessary. For Claims in which the claimant seeks USD $10,000
      or more, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing
      to be necessary, hearings will be conducted by video or telephone, unless
      the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing to be necessary. If an
      in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the
      hearing will take place in San Francisco, California,
      <a>unless you are a Consumer and the arbitrator determines that this would
        pose a hardship for</a>
      you, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the
      claimant's state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United
      States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the
      applicable Rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve all Claims in
      arbitration. Unless you and Company agree otherwise, any decision or award
      will include a written statement stating the decision of each Claim and
      the basis for the award, including the arbitrator's essential factual and
      legal findings and conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      An arbitration award, and any judgment confirming it, apply only to that
      specific case; it cannot be used or offered as precedent in any other case
      except to enforce the award itself unless the parties agree prior to
      issuance of the award. Any arbitration decision or award may be enforced
      as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if
      applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial
      confirmation of any award and an order of enforcement.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>. Each party will be responsible for
        arbitration fees in accordance with the applicable Rules and these
        Terms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frivolous or Improper Claims</strong>. To the extent permitted
        by applicable law, a claimant must pay all costs incurred by the
        responding party, including any attorney fees, related to a Claim if an
        arbitrator determines that (i) the Claim was frivolous or (ii) the Claim
        was filed in arbitration for any improper purpose, such as to harass the
        defending party, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the
        cost of dispute resolution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>One Year to Assert Claims</strong>. To the extent permitted by
        law, any Claim by you or Company against the other must be filed within
        one year after such Claim arises; otherwise, the Claim is permanently
        barred, which means that you or Company will no longer have the right to
        assert that Claim.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Confidentiality</strong>. If you or Company submits a Claim to
        arbitration, you and Company agree to cooperate to seek from the
        arbitrator protection for any confidential, proprietary, trade secret,
        or otherwise sensitive information, documents, testimony, and other
        materials that might be exchanged or the subject of any discovery in the
        arbitration. You and Company agree to seek such protection before any
        such information, documents, testimony, or materials are exchanged or
        otherwise become the subject of discovery in the arbitration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mass Arbitrations</strong>. If 25 or more Claimant Notices are
        received by a party that raise similar claims and have the same or
        coordinated counsel, these will be considered "<strong>Mass Arbitrations</strong>" and will be treated as mass arbitrations according to the AAA's Mass
        Arbitration Supplementary Rules, if and to the extent Mass Arbitrations
        are filed in arbitration as set forth in these Terms. You or Company may
        advise the other of your or Company's belief that Claims are Mass
        Arbitrations, and disputes over whether a Claim meets the definition of
        "Mass Arbitrations" will be decided by the arbitration provider as an
        administrative matter. To the extent either party is asserting the same
        Claim as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated
        counsel, that party waives any objection that the joinder of all such
        persons is impracticable. The following procedures are intended to
        supplement the AAA's Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, and to the
        extent the procedures conflict with those Rules, to supersede them.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Mass Arbitrations may only be filed in arbitration as permitted by the
        process set forth below. Applicable statutes of limitations will be
        tolled for Claims asserted in Mass Arbitrations from the time a
        compliant Claimant Notice has been received by a party until these Terms
        permits such Mass Arbitration to be filed in arbitration or
        court.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Initial Bellwether: The bellwether process set forth in this section will
      not proceed until counsel representing the Mass Arbitrations has advised
      the other party in writing (email suffices) that all or substantially all
      the Claimant Notices for the Mass Arbitrations have been submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that point, counsel for the parties will select 30 Mass Arbitrations
      to proceed in arbitration as a bellwether to allow each side to test the
      merits of its arguments. Each side will select 15 claimants who have
      provided compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose, and only those
      chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. The parties
      acknowledge that resolution of some Mass Arbitrations will be delayed by
      this bellwether process. Any remaining Mass Arbitrations shall not be
      filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be
      assessed in connection with those Claims, unless and until they are
      selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as set out in
      this Section 18(j).
    </p>
    <p>
      A single arbitrator will preside over each Mass Arbitration chosen for a
      bellwether proceeding, and only one Mass Arbitration may be assigned to
      each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mediation: Once the arbitrations that are part of the bellwether process
      have concluded (or sooner if the claimants and the other party agree),
      counsel for the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining
      Mass Arbitrations, <a>with the mediator's fee paid for by</a> Company.
      Counsel for the claimants and the other party must agree on a mediator
      within 30 days after the conclusion of the last bellwether arbitration. If
      counsel for the claimants and the other party cannot agree on a mediator
      within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an
      administrative matter. All parties will cooperate for the purpose of
      ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after
      the mediator is appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remaining Claims: If the mediation process concludes with 100 or more
      unresolved Mass Arbitrations remaining, any party to a remaining Mass
      Arbitration may elect to no longer have the arbitration requirement in
      this Section 18 apply to all remaining Mass Arbitrations for which a
      compliant Claimant Notice was received by the other party but that were
      not resolved in the bellwether process or global mediation. To be
      effective, such an election must be communicated in writing (email
      suffices) to counsel for the opposing party (or to the opposing party if
      they do not have counsel) within 30 days of mediation concluding. Mass
      Arbitrations released from the arbitration requirement must be resolved in
      accordance with Section 19.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the mediation process concludes with fewer than 100 Mass Arbitrations
      remaining or if no party makes a timely election as provided for in the
      previous paragraph, the AAA will randomly select 50 Mass Arbitrations (or
      the total remaining amount if less than 50) to proceed in arbitration as a
      second batch. The AAA will randomly select eligible claimants who have
      provided compliant Claimant Notices for this purpose, and only those
      chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. A single
      arbitrator will preside over each Mass Arbitration chosen for this second
      batch, and only one Mass Arbitration may be assigned to each arbitrator as
      part of this second batch unless the parties agree otherwise. Once all
      arbitrations in the foregoing process are complete, the parties will
      repeat this process until all Mass Arbitrations have been arbitrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a>If Mass Arbitrations released from the arbitration requirement are
        brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest
        extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only
        the claimants in Mass Arbitrations for which a compliant Claimant Notice
        was received by the other party.</a>
      Any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation
      and on any available basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      A court will have authority to enforce the bellwether and mediation
      processes defined in this section and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or
      arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.

        this Section 18; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must proceed on
        a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis as a result,
        such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent
        jurisdiction, in accordance with these Terms, and not in arbitration.
        The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any
        individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section
        18 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive
        relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is
        allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this
        Section 18 will be enforceable.
