      <strong>Last Updated:</strong> <strong>April 20</strong><strong>th</strong><strong>, 2025</strong>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how fal - Features &amp; Labels Inc.
      ("<strong>fal</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," or "<strong>us</strong>")
      collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes information about you
      when you access or use our website,
      <a href="https://fal.ai/">https://fal.ai/</a> and other online products
      and services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our
      "<strong>Services</strong>") and when you otherwise interact with us such
      as through our customer support channels.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      fal's primary business offering is an AI-powered generative media platform
      for developers to integrate into their applications, though we also offer
      a version of our platform directly to individuals through our Services. If
      you are an enterprise user of the Services, and your use is governed by an
      enterprise contract, we handle your personal information as a service
      provider (sometimes called a "processor") on behalf of the enterprise
      customer. Personal information processed on behalf of our enterprise
      customers is therefore not subject to this Privacy Policy. If you are an
      enterprise user of our Services, please contact the enterprise customer
      who has provided you with access to our Services.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <a>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
        changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this
        policy. If we make material changes, we will provide you with additional
        notice (such as by adding a statement to the Services or sending you a
        notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly
        to stay informed about our information practices and the choices
        available to you.</a>

      <li>
        When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive
