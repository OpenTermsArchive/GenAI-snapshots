<p>4.1. To use the Service you have to register and create a service account (“Account”). You can create multiple sub-accounts under the Account. When registering to the Service, and at any time during the term of the Agreement, you must provide true, accurate and complete information as required by Berget, and keep your information up-to-date. If you provide inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent information, we have the right to suspend and/or terminate your access to and use of the Service in accordance with Section 13 below.</p>
<p>4.2. After you have created the Account, you and the Users can setup and provision services - such actions are considered Orders. You will be responsible for all Orders made under your Account, whether by you, the Users, or your systems automatically. You will be responsible for the payment of all service fees based on the Orders made under your Account. Berget will be deemed to have accepted the Order if Berget supplies the ordered Service. We reserve the right to limit or restrict your ability to place Orders.</p>
<p>4.3. You will be liable for all activities conducted in the Service under your Account, including any actions taken by the Users. You must comply, and you must ensure that the Users comply with the AUP and all user instructions relating to the Service. You will be responsible for any violations of the AUP or the user instructions by the Users.</p>
<p>4.4. You must safeguard, and ensure that any Users safeguard, the usernames and passwords of your Account. You must promptly inform us if you suspect that an unauthorised third party is using, or may have an access to, the Service or your Account.

<h4></h4>
<h2>5. Right to Access the Service</h2>

<h4></h4>
<h2>6. Provision of the Service, Service Levels, Warranties &amp; Security</h2>
<p>6.1. We will perform the Service in accordance with these Terms with commercially reasonable care and skill and in all material respects as described in the Service Descriptions.</p>
<p>6.2. If you consider that the Service provided to you was not performed as described in the relevant Service Description, you must promptly provide us with a written notice that describes the deficiency in the Service.</p>

The Service is not designed to be error-free or uninterrupted and therefore it is neither intended nor fit for purposes that require fail-safe performance. The remedies set forth in this Section 6 will be your sole and exclusive remedies for any defects, deficiencies or interruptions in the Service.</p>
<p>6.6 Berget maintains commercially reasonable business continuity and disaster recovery measures designed to restore the availability of the Service in the event of an incident. While Berget does not guarantee uninterrupted service, we implement redundant infrastructure and regular data backups for core systems, excluding Customer Data unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

Berget is actively working toward ISO 27001 certification to formalize its information security management system. More information about our security practices is available upon request.</p>
<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>For the provisioning of services as well as improving our service offering, optimize our performance and charge correctly for our service - we might collect data such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed service logs</li>
<li>API request metadata (HTTP Calls, status codes, time stamps)</li>
<li>Compute resource token counts</li>
<li>Inference token input and output counts for LLMs</li>
<li>User defined parameters</li>
</ul>

The Credits are non-refundable and non-transferable unless otherwise decided by Berget at its sole discretion. Through your Account, you can download invoices for the Credits you have purchased.</p>
<p>12.2. To use the Service, you must have a positive Credit balance on your Account. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have sufficient amount of Credits deposited on your Account at all times to cover the service fees associated with the Service you have subscribed for.</p>
<p>If your Credit balance runs out (zero or negative balance), we have the right to suspend your use of the Service. If you do not remedy the negative or zero balance and deposit Credits to your Account within a reasonable time determined by Berget (at a minimum fourteen (14) days), we will consider the Agreement terminated and will close your Account.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise required by law, we will retain your Customer Data for a period of thirty (30) days following termination to allow for data export or recovery. After this period, Customer Data will be irreversibly deleted, unless longer retention is required by applicable law or Governmental Authority. You are obliged to pay applicable service fees (e.g. for storage and IP addresses) even during the suspension until the Agreement is terminated.</p>
<h2>13. Free Trials</h2>
<p>13.1. We may from time to time offer trials of the Service for a specified period without payment obligation by offering you free-of-charge Credits or by way of a money-back guarantee (“Free Trial”). The features of the Service may be limited during the Free Trial. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to determine the Customer’s eligibility for a Free Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or modify a Free Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.</p>
<p>13.2. We may require you to provide payment details to start the Free Trial. After the expiry of the Free Trial, we have the right to start charging for the Service the applicable service fees in accordance with Section 11 above and according to the currently valid public price list.</p>

<p>16.3. Berget shall not, however, be liable for any infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or claim thereof if the claim:<br>
(i) is made by an Affiliate of the Customer;<br>
(ii) results from a modification of or an addition to the Service done by the Customer, a User, or any third-party at the Customer’s request;<br>
(iii) results  from the use of the Service in combination with any product or service not provided or approved by Berget;<br>
(iv) could have been avoided by using the latest available version of the Service provided by Berget; or<br>
(v) is not related to the Service, or is related to a part of the Service for which Berget is not responsible for pursuant to the Agreement.</p>
<p>16.4. If the third-party claimant is adjudged liable or agrees in a settlement to pay a compensation to the Customer, then the Customer shall remit such compensation to Berget immediately after receiving it from the third-party claimant.</p>
<p>16.5. The Clauses 16.1–16.4 above contain Berget’s entire liability and the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy in case the Service infringes on third-party intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>16.6. The Customer shall, at its own expense, defend and hold Berget harmless against any third-party claims, including investigations by Governmental Authorities, brought against Berget (“Claim”) as a result of any breach of the Agreement by the Customer and/or User, and indemnify Berget against: (i) any damages awarded by a court of law to the third-party claimant; (ii) any liabilities imposed on Berget as a result of the Claim; (iii) any settlement costs and fees approved by the Customer and paid by Berget to the third-party claimant; and (iv) any costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) suffered or incurred by Berget as a result of the Claim.</p>

<h2>17. Customer Data</h2>
<p>17.1. As between Berget and the Customer, the Customer retains all title and intellectual property rights in and to the Customer Data. You grant Berget the right to host, use, process, display and transmit Customer Data to provide the Service in accordance with the Agreement. You have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of Customer Data, and for obtaining necessary rights and consents related to Customer Data to allow Berget to perform the Service. If you do not have necessary rights or consents related to the Customer Data, you are not allowed to upload or store such Customer Data in the Service. Within a reasonable time after the termination or expiry of the Agreement, or after you have permanently ceased using the Services, Berget will delete all Customer Data under your Account, unless Berget is obliged to retain copies of the Customer Data pursuant to applicable laws or orders of Governmental Authority.</p>
<p>17.2. If the Customer Data contains personal data, the provisions of the DPA shall govern the processing of that personal data by Berget.  With the exception of obligations relating to the personal data set forth in the DPA, we do not assume any liability with respect to the Customer Data, nor do we endorse any opinion contained in the Customer Data.</p>
<p>17.3. You must ensure that the Customer Data does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights or violate any applicable laws or regulations. You shall not upload or store any Illegal Content, or any infringing, offensive, threatening, libellous, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate data or content to the Service.</p>
<p>17.4. You are responsible for making necessary and appropriate backup copies of the Customer Data stored in the Service. Such backup copies must be stored outside the Service.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>18. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>18.1. The Parties may exchange Confidential Information during the performance of the Agreement. “Confidential Information” means any non-public information which is marked as confidential or which should be understood as confidential, irrespective of its form of storage or disclosure, including in particular Customer Data. Any information of or relating to a Party or that Party’s Affiliates, personnel, suppliers, contractors, customers or end-users, which information is obtained or detected by the other Party or processed or generated in the course of providing or receiving the Service shall be deemed Confidential Information of that Party.</p>
<p>18.2. All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the disclosing Party, and the receiving Party shall keep it confidential and refrain from using it otherwise than for the purposes of the Agreement. The Parties shall limit access to the Confidential Information within their organisations to only those Affiliates, employees, directors, officers, agents, and advisors (including attorneys, accountants, and consultants) (collectively, “Associates”) who need to access the Confidential Information for the purposes of the Agreement. The receiving Party shall ensure that its Associates are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those set forth herein before disclosing any Confidential Information.</p>
<p>18.3. The confidentiality obligations herein shall not apply to Confidential Information which:<br>
(i) is or becomes known publicly through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving Party;<br>
(ii) was known to the receiving Party prior to the disclosure hereunder, and has not been obtained directly or indirectly from the disclosing Party;<br>
(iii) is lawfully disclosed to the receiving Party in good faith by a third party having rights therein without restriction on disclosure;<br>
(iv) has been approved for release by the disclosing Party; or<br>
(v) has been independently developed by the receiving Party without the use of and prior to receiving the Confidential Information from the disclosing Party.</p>
<p>18.4. Notwithstanding the above, the receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to third parties where compelled to do so by law or an order of Governmental Authority. Unless prohibited by law or an order of Governmental Authority, the receiving Party shall take reasonable steps to notify the disclosing Party of such disclosure request or order.</p>
<p>18.5. Each Party shall promptly upon termination of the Agreement cease using Confidential Information of the other Party and use reasonable means to destroy such Confidential Information. Each Party shall, however, be entitled to retain the copies of Confidential Information which: (i) the Party is required to retain by applicable laws; and (ii) are generated pursuant to the receiving Party’s electronic backup system if destroying such copies would be unreasonable taking into account the costs and effort required to do so.</p>

<p>20.2. Berget’s maximum liability under or in connection with the Agreement shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate service fees paid by the Customer to Berget during the last six (6) months immediately preceding the occurrence of the event giving rise to the liability (“Liability Cap”). Notwithstanding the above, Berget’s maximum liability for damage caused by a breach of the DPA shall be limited to two (2) times the Liability Cap.</p>
<p>20.3. The above limitations of liability shall not apply to damage caused intentionally or by gross negligence, or to liability which, under the applicable law, cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>20.4. In order to be valid and enforceable, the Customer must present any claims for damages within six (6) months after the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
<h2>21. Force Majeure</h2>

Force Majeure is an event that prevents, or makes unduly difficult, the performance of the Service or the fulfilment of the provisions of the Agreement, such as war, rebellion, natural catastrophe, act of government, general interruption in energy distribution or telecommunications, fire, strike, embargoes or sanctions, or another equally significant event independent of a Party. Each Party shall be entitled to suspend its duties without liability thereof in case of Force Majeure affecting the Party either directly or indirectly through its subcontractor.</p>

<p>23.2. Berget may ask the Customer to participate in a case study about the Customer’s use of the Service. Berget is not allowed to publish the case study without the Customer’s prior approval. Provided that the Customer approves the case study, Berget shall have a royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide right and licence to reproduce, publish, distribute, and translate the case study, whether in written or recorded form. The case study may be used on Berget’s website, Berget’s social media channels (such as YouTube, and LinkedIn), and other sales and marketing presentations and materials.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>24. Termination for Convenience</h2>
<p>You have the right to terminate the Agreement for any reason by issuing at least five (5) days’ written notice to us and we have the right to terminate the Agreement for any reason by issuing at least 30 (thirty) days’ written notice to you. However, if the Parties have signed a separate fixed-term contract by which you commit to using the Service for a fixed contract period, then the Parties’ right to terminate the Agreement shall be controlled by the terms of that separate contract.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>25. Termination for Cause</h2>
<p>Either Party may terminate the Agreement with immediate effect if the other Party:<br>
(i) has materially breached the Agreement and has not remedied the breach within 10 (ten) business days from the receipt of a written notice thereof from the other Party; or<br>
(ii) files for bankruptcy or debt rescheduling program, is put into liquidation, or is made subject to any other similar procedures, ceases its payments, or fails to pay its invoices when due.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>26. Entire Agreement and Amendments</h2>
<p>26.1. The Agreement (including all webpages and documents referred to or linked herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all previous commitments between the Parties in respect of the provision of the Service.</p>
<p>26.2. All amendments to the Agreement must be made in writing. We have the right to modify these Terms by posting a revised version of the Terms on Berget’s website. If we consider the revision to be material, we will notify you in writing at least 30 (thirty) days before the revision will be effected and reserve you a possibility to terminate the Agreement, unless the revision is implemented due to changes in legislation, in which case we may effect it without an advance notice. If you continue using the Service, you will be deemed to have accepted the revised Terms as part of the Agreement.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>27. Non-Waiver</h2>
<p>A failure by either Party to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not be deemed to constitute a present or future waiver of such provision. All waivers must be made in writing.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>28. Assignment and Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>
<p>28.1. Neither Party may transfer the Agreement without the other Party’s prior written consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

Berget has the right to use its Affiliates and other qualified subcontractors to provide the Service to the Customer, provided that Berget remains responsible to the Customer for the performance of the subcontractors.</p>
<p>28.2. The Customer’s obligations towards Berget and the provisions regarding Berget’s limitations of liability are in place also for the benefit of Berget’s Affiliates, subcontractors, personnel and owners. Otherwise the Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any third party.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>29. Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of the Agreement is ruled unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.
