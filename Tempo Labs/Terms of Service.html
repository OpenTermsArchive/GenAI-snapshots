<p>We may amend these Terms at any time.</p>
<p>You may not assign this Agreement to any person other than in connection with a sale of substantially all of your assets to a third party. This Agreement (including the Order Form, if applicable) contains the complete understanding and agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, oral or written, with respect thereto. Each Party hereby rejects the inclusion of any pre-printed terms and conditions on any purchase orders or other such contract documents.</p>
<p>We may give any notices issued in connection with this Agreement by email to you at the email address given by you when creating your account, and such notices shall be effective upon confirmation of transmission to you. Neither Party will be liable to the other Party for any failure or delay in performance by circumstances beyond its control, including fire, labor difficulties, telecommunication failures, Internet unavailability, governmental actions, or terrorism, provided that the Party seeking to rely on such circumstances gives written notice of such circumstances to the other Party and uses reasonable efforts to overcome such circumstances.</p>
<p>Any question, claim, or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement (a “Dispute”) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws provision thereof or of any other jurisdiction that would produce a contrary result. In the event of any Dispute, the designated representatives of you and us shall promptly confer and exert their good faith efforts to reach a reasonable and equitable resolution of such Dispute. If such representatives are unable to resolve such Dispute within five business days, the Dispute shall be referred promptly to the responsible senior management of each Party for resolution. Neither Party shall seek any other means of resolving any Dispute until both Partiesʼ responsible senior management have had at least five business days to resolve the Dispute. If the Parties are unable to resolve the Dispute in accordance with the foregoing procedure, then either Party may, at any time, deliver notice to the other Party of its intent to submit the Dispute to the Court of the Province of Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture, or other form of joint enterprise or employment relationship between the Parties, and neither Party shall have authority to contract for or bind the other Party in any manner whatsoever.</p>
<p>No waiver by either Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement is effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by such Party. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement operates, or may be construed, as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder precludes any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or illegal by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable, or will be severed from this Agreement, and all other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
