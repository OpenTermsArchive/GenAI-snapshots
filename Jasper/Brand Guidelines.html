Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Governing Law. </strong>You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in Delaware; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Delaware. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 11(b) and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p><p><strong>(b) Arbitration.</strong> Read this Section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Jasper. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Jasper that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Jasper, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to this Agreement.</p><p>If you are a new Jasper user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Jasper at hey@jasper.ai with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p><p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at hey@jasper.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Jasper has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein.  In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.  AAA may be contacted at<a href="http://www.adr.org/"> www.adr.org</a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or Delaware, unless you and Jasper agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Jasper agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p><p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Jasper from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. </p><p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p><strong>(c) Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND JASPER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER JASPER USERS. YOU AND JASPER FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND JASPER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.</p><p><strong>12. Miscellaneous</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong> This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Jasper in connection with the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Jasper concerning the Services. Except as otherwise stated in Section<strong> </strong>11(b), if any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision herein does not affect any other provision herein or the validity, legality, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>(b) Modifications.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time, and that modified terms become effective on posting. We will notify you of material modifications through direct email or visible banner in the Services. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the modifications will be deemed acceptance of the modified terms. Jasper will provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of changes to any service level that Jasper reasonably anticipates may result in a material reduction in quality or services.</p><p><strong>(c) Export Regulation.</strong> The Services utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Services or the software or technology included in the Services to, or make the Services or the software or technology included in the Services accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, regulation, or rule. You shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Services or the software or technology included in the Services available outside the US.</p><p><strong>(d) US Government Rights.</strong> Each of the software components that constitute the Services and the Documentation is a “commercial product” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if you are an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government customers and their contractors</p><p><strong>(e) No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Jasper’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any failure to act by us with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit our rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.</p><p><strong>(f) Notices.</strong> Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, any notices to us must be sent to our corporate headquarters at 3001 Bee Caves Road, Suite 100 A, Rollingwood, TX 78746 and must be delivered either in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or by recognized overnight courier service, and are deemed given upon receipt by us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby consent to receiving electronic communications from us. Jasper may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Jasper in our sole discretion. Jasper reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Jasper is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. You shall also send an electronic copy of any notice to <a href="mailto:legal@jasper.ai">legal@jasper.ai</a>.</p><p><strong>(g) Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, is personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever without our prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing will be void and without effect. We expressly reserve the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.</p><p> </p><p>Please contact us at legal@jasper.ai with any questions regarding this Agreement</p>

This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 11(b) and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.

This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Jasper that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Jasper, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to this Agreement.</p><p>If you are a new Jasper user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Jasper at hey@jasper.ai with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p><p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at hey@jasper.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Jasper has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein.  In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.  AAA may be contacted at<a href="http://www.adr.org/"> www.adr.org</a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or Delaware, unless you and Jasper agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Jasper agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p><p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Jasper from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. </p><p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p><strong>(c) Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND JASPER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER JASPER USERS. YOU AND JASPER FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND JASPER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.</p><p><strong>12. Miscellaneous</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong> This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Jasper in connection with the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Jasper concerning the Services. Except as otherwise stated in Section<strong> </strong>11(b), if any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision herein does not affect any other provision herein or the validity, legality, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>(b) Modifications.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time, and that modified terms become effective on posting. We will notify you of material modifications through direct email or visible banner in the Services. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the modifications will be deemed acceptance of the modified terms. Jasper will provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of changes to any service level that Jasper reasonably anticipates may result in a material reduction in quality or services.</p><p><strong>(c) Export Regulation.</strong> The Services utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Services or the software or technology included in the Services to, or make the Services or the software or technology included in the Services accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, regulation, or rule. You shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Services or the software or technology included in the Services available outside the US.</p><p><strong>(d) US Government Rights.</strong> Each of the software components that constitute the Services and the Documentation is a “commercial product” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if you are an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government customers and their contractors</p><p><strong>(e) No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Jasper’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any failure to act by us with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit our rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.</p><p><strong>(f) Notices.</strong> Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, any notices to us must be sent to our corporate headquarters at 3001 Bee Caves Road, Suite 100 A, Rollingwood, TX 78746 and must be delivered either in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or by recognized overnight courier service, and are deemed given upon receipt by us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby consent to receiving electronic communications from us. Jasper may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Jasper in our sole discretion. Jasper reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Jasper is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p><p><strong>(g) Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, is personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever without our prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing will be void and without effect. We expressly reserve the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.</p><p> </p><p>Please contact us at legal@jasper.ai with any questions regarding this Agreement</p>

Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Governing Law. </strong>You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in Delaware; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Delaware. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 11(b) and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p><p><strong>(b) Arbitration.</strong> Read this Section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Jasper. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Jasper that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Jasper, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to this Agreement.</p><p>If you are a new Jasper user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Jasper at hey@jasper.ai with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p><p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at hey@jasper.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Jasper has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein.  In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.  AAA may be contacted at<a href="http://www.adr.org/"> www.adr.org</a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or Delaware, unless you and Jasper agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Jasper agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p><p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Jasper from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. </p><p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p><strong>(c) Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND JASPER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER JASPER USERS. YOU AND JASPER FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND JASPER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.</p><p><strong>12. Miscellaneous</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong> This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Jasper in connection with the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Jasper concerning the Services. Except as otherwise stated in Section<strong> </strong>11(b), if any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision herein does not affect any other provision herein or the validity, legality, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>(b) Modifications.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time, and that modified terms become effective on posting. We will notify you of material modifications through direct email or visible banner in the Services. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the modifications will be deemed acceptance of the modified terms. Jasper will provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of changes to any service level that Jasper reasonably anticipates may result in a material reduction in quality or services.</p><p><strong>(c) Export Regulation.</strong> The Services utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Services or the software or technology included in the Services to, or make the Services or the software or technology included in the Services accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, regulation, or rule. You shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Services or the software or technology included in the Services available outside the US.</p><p><strong>(d) US Government Rights.</strong> Each of the software components that constitute the Services and the Documentation is a “commercial product” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if you are an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government customers and their contractors</p><p><strong>(e) No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Jasper’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any failure to act by us with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit our rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.</p><p><strong>(f) Notices.</strong> Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, any notices to us must be sent to our corporate headquarters at 3001 Bee Caves Road, Suite 100 B, Rollingwood, TX 78746 and must be delivered either in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or by recognized overnight courier service, and are deemed given upon receipt by us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby consent to receiving electronic communications from us. Jasper may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Jasper in our sole discretion. Jasper reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Jasper is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p><p><strong>(g) Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, is personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever without our prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing will be void and without effect. We expressly reserve the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.</p><p> </p><p>Please contact us at legal@jasper.ai with any questions regarding this Agreement</p>

Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Governing Law. </strong>You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in Delaware; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Delaware. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 11(b) and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p><p><strong>(b) Arbitration.</strong> Read this Section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Jasper. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Jasper that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Jasper, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to this Agreement.</p><p>If you are a new Jasper user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Jasper at hey@jasper.ai with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p><p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at hey@jasper.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Jasper has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein.  In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.  AAA may be contacted at<a href="http://www.adr.org/"> www.adr.org</a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or Delaware, unless you and Jasper agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Jasper agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p><p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Jasper from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. </p><p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p><strong>(c) Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND JASPER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER JASPER USERS. YOU AND JASPER FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND JASPER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.</p><p><strong>12. Miscellaneous</strong></p><p><strong>(a) Entire Agreement/Severability.</strong> This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Jasper in connection with the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Jasper concerning the Services. Except as otherwise stated in Section<strong> </strong>11(b), if any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision herein does not affect any other provision herein or the validity, legality, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.</p><p><strong>(b) Modifications.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time, and that modified terms become effective on posting. We will notify you of material modifications through direct email or visible banner in the Services. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the modifications will be deemed acceptance of the modified terms. Jasper will provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of changes to any service level that Jasper reasonably anticipates may result in a material reduction in quality or services.</p><p><strong>(c) Export Regulation.</strong> The Services utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Services or the software or technology included in the Services to, or make the Services or the software or technology included in the Services accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, regulation, or rule. You shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Services or the software or technology included in the Services available outside the US.</p><p><strong>(d) US Government Rights.</strong> Each of the software components that constitute the Services and the Documentation is a “commercial product” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if you are an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government customers and their contractors</p><p><strong>(e) No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Jasper’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any failure to act by us with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit our rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.</p><p><strong>(f) Notices.</strong> Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, any notices to us must be sent to our corporate headquarters at 3001 Bee Caves Road, Suite 100 B, Rollingwood, TX 78746 and must be delivered either in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or by recognized overnight courier service, and are deemed given upon receipt by us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby consent to receiving electronic communications from us. Jasper may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Jasper in our sole discretion. Jasper reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Jasper is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p><p><strong>(g) Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, is personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever without our prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing will be void and without effect. We expressly reserve the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.</p><p> </p><p>Please contact us at legal@jasper.ai with any questions regarding this Agreement</p>

Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</strong></p><p>(a)        Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Services shall be deemed solely based in Delaware; and (ii) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Delaware. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 11(b) and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p><p>(b)        Arbitration. Read this Section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Jasper. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and Jasper that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (c) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Jasper, directly or indirectly, as a consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your agreement to this Agreement.</p><p>If you are a new Jasper user, you can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Jasper at hey@jasper.ai with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement. Note that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p><p>For any Claim, you agree to first contact us at hey@jasper.ai and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Jasper has not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by AAA before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”), under the Expedited Procedures then in effect for AAA (the “Rules”), except as provided herein.  In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.  AAA may be contacted at<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230207110557/http://www.adr.org/"> www.adr.org</a>, where the Rules are also available. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. county where you live or Delaware, unless you and Jasper agree otherwise. If you are using the Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) AAA may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from AAA; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Jasper agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Agreement, any provision of the Agreement, is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p><p>Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as: preventing Jasper from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. </p><p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.  All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p>(c)        Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICES FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND JASPER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).  ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER JASPER USERS. YOU AND JASPER FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND JASPER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER.</p><p><strong>12.        Miscellaneous.</strong></p><p>(a)        Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Jasper in connection with the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Jasper concerning the Services. Except as otherwise stated in Section 11(b), if any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision herein does not affect any other provision herein or the validity, legality, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.</p><p>(b)        Modifications. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time, and that modified terms become effective on posting. You will be notified of modifications through direct email communication from us. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the modifications will be deemed acceptance of the modified terms. Jasper will provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of changes to any service level that Jasper reasonably anticipates may result in a material reduction in quality or services.</p><p>(c)        Export Regulation. The Services utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. You shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Services or the software or technology included in the Services to, or make the Services or the software or technology included in the Services accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, regulation, or rule. You shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Services or the software or technology included in the Services available outside the US.</p><p>(d)        US Government Rights. Each of the software components that constitute the Services and the Documentation is a “commercial product” as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if you are an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, you receive only those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government customers and their contractors</p><p>(e)        No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Jasper’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any failure to act by us with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not constitute a waiver and will not limit our rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.</p><p>(f)         Notices. Unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement, any notices to us must be sent to our corporate headquarters at 3001 Bee Caves Road, Suite 100 B, Rollingwood, TX 78746 and must be delivered either in person, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or by recognized overnight courier service, and are deemed given upon receipt by us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby consent to receiving electronic communications from us. Jasper may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Jasper in our sole discretion. Jasper reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Jasper is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p><p>(g)        Assignment. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, is personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever without our prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing will be void and without effect. We expressly reserve the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.</p><p> </p><p>Please contact us at legal@jasper.ai with any questions regarding this Agreement.</p>

If Customer adds additional Services during a Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Fees associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of the then-current Subscription Term and charged to Customer and due and payable in accordance with Section 3(b). If Customer’s usage of the Services exceeds the purchased quantities, Customer will be provided with written notice of such excess usage and five (5) days to reduce its usage to the purchased levels.  To the extent Customer’s usage exceeds the purchased quantities at the end of such period, Customer will be deemed to have executed a Subscription Upgrade with respect to such excess Services and will be invoiced accordingly. In any automatic renewal of the Subscription Term (if applicable), the Fees and quantities will include all prior Subscription Upgrades. Fees are quoted and payable in United States dollars.  Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, payment obligations are non-cancellable and Fees paid are non-refundable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Invoices and Payment.</em> Jasper will invoice Customer for the charges at the email address on file with Jasper.  Customer will pay all invoiced amounts within the timeframe listed on the respective Order Form.  Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form, Customer will pay all Fees on an annual, prepaid basis. Overdue invoices are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Taxes.</em> Customer is solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, assessments, tariffs, duties, or other fees imposed, assessed, or collected by or under the authority of any governmental body arising from Jasper’s provision of the Services hereunder (collectively, “Taxes”), except any taxes assessed upon Jasper’s net income. Jasper will invoice Customer for Taxes imposed by governmental bodies in the United States. If Jasper is required to directly pay Taxes related to Customer’s use or receipt of any Services, Customer agrees to promptly reimburse Jasper for any amounts paid by Jasper.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intellectual Property Ownership</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Customer Property.</em> As between Customer and Jasper, Customer retains any and all rights, title, and interest in and to the Customer Property, including any and all intellectual property rights embodied in or related to the Customer Property. Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, no right, title, or license under any Customer Property is granted to Jasper or implied hereby.  To the extent that ownership of the Inputs or Outputs does not automatically vest in Customer, Jasper hereby assigns all of its right title and interest in and to the Inputs and Outputs to Customer; provided, however, Customer acknowledges that due to the nature of machine learning, the Output may not be unique and the Services may generate the same or similar output for Jasper or a third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Property.</em> As between Jasper and Customer, Jasper retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Jasper Property, including all intellectual property rights embodied in or related to the Jasper Property. Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, no right, title, or license under any Jasper Property is granted to Customer or implied hereby.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Licenses to Jasper.</em> Customer hereby grants Jasper a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in connection with the permitted assignment of this Agreement), and royalty-free license to access and use the Customer Property solely to provide the Services to Customer pursuant to this Agreement. Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Feedback</em>. By submitting to Jasper any unsolicited suggestions, enhancement requests, comments, or other feedback relating to the Services (“Feedback”), Customer and its Users (as applicable) grant to Jasper a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate such Feedback into the Services in any manner.  For the avoidance of doubt, Feedback excludes all Customer Property.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Usage</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Non-Training of Models</em>. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Jasper shall not use, nor permit a third party to use, Customer Property to train artificial intelligence models utilized by the Service.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>System Performance</em>. Jasper may use data concerning Customer’s or its Users’ use of the Services (“Usage Information”), including but not limited to compiling statistical and performance information related to the operation of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Usage Information excludes all Customer Property.  The foregoing shall not limit, in any way, Jasper’s confidentiality obligations as set forth in Section 7 of the Agreement. Customer agrees that Jasper may make Usage Information publicly available, provided that such use does not identify Customer or any Users either directly or indirectly. Jasper retains all intellectual property rights in Usage Information.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Information Security Requirements</em>. Jasper will maintain an information security program (including the adoption and enforcement of internal policies and procedures) designed to (a) secure the Services and Customer Property against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure, (b) identify reasonably foreseeable and internal risks to security and unauthorized access, and (c) minimize security risks, including through risk assessment and regular testing. As part of this information security program, Jasper shall implement the security measures set forth at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements">legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Hosting and Processing</em>. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by Jasper, Customer Property may be hosted by Jasper or its Affiliates, or their respective authorized third-party service providers, in the United States, the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or the United Kingdom.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Processing of Personal Data</em>. The Parties acknowledge that use of the Service does not require Jasper  to process Personal Data on behalf of Customer.  In other words, Customer acknowledges that it does not need to provide Input that contains Personal Data in order to make effective use of the Services.  However, if Customer wishes to submit Personal Data to Jasper for processing on its behalf, it must first execute a Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) with Jasper, which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#dpa">legal.jasper.ai/#dpa</a>. Upon execution of the DPA by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.  To the extent that Jasper processes Personal Data in its capacity as a data controller, such processing will be in accordance with Jasper’s Privacy Policy which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#privacy">legal.jasper.ai/#privacy</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Third Party Service Providers</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use third party service providers who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of such service providers to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each service provider directly under the terms of this Agreement. A list of all such service providers can be found here: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors">legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In-Product Cookies</em>. Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy, accessible at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#cookies">legal.jasper.ai/#cookies</a>, applies. When Jasper collects this information, it only uses this data to (i) provide the Services, or (ii) in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify the Customers or Users personally.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Confidentiality.</em> During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind, but in no event with less than a reasonable standard of care; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, or agents who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information. This Section shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Destruction of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Warranties.</em> Jasper warrants to Customer that the Services purchased by Customer will, in all material respects, perform in accordance with the applicable portions of the Documentation. As Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of the warranty set forth in this Section 8(b), Jasper will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Services to comply with such warranty without charge. If Jasper is unable to make the Services operate as warranted within thirty (30) days after Customer’s written notice, then Customer or Jasper may terminate this Agreement and/or the applicable Order Form, and Jasper will refund any fees actually paid by Customer (excluding any non-recurring fees) to Jasper for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN ADDITION, JASPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF CUSTOMER PROPERTY STORED BY JASPER.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Beta Services.</em> Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services at its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services will not be provided to Customer or any of its Users unless it expressly opts-in to use such services.  Further, Beta Services are provided “as-is” and not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 8 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 9(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions on Customer’s use of the Services, Jasper’s reservation of rights, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper shall indemnify and defend Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and any outstanding Order Forms and refund to Customer prepaid unused Fees for the infringing items. Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from: (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network, or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); or (4) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer shall indemnify and defend Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark, publicity, trade secret or other intellectual property , publicity or privacy right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of Sections 3, 4, and 5 of the Platform Guidelines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification Conditions. </em>The Parties’ obligations under this Section are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusion of Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE, OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cap on Monetary Liability.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY AND PAYABLE FROM CUSTOMER HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE (THE “BASE CAP”). <span data-content-locator="{">HOWEVER, A PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM ITS BREACH OF SECTION 6</span><span data-content-locator="{"> (DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY)</span><span data-content-locator="{"> </span><span data-content-locator="{">OR THE DPA </span><span data-content-locator="{">SHALL NOT EXCEED THREE TIMES (3X) THE BASE CAP. </span><span data-content-locator="{">THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF A PARTY’S REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE</span>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusions</em>.

At the expiration of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Term for all purchased services will automatically renew for the same period as the renewing Subscription Term, unless either Party elects to not renew by notifying the other Party in writing at least 30 days before such renewal. Except as otherwise specified in a written notice sent to Customer at least 30 days prior to a renewal and only to the extent an Order From automatically renews, Jasper’s per-unit pricing for any renewal of the Subscription Term in such Order From shall not increase by more than the greater of (i) five percent (5%) per year, and (ii) the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in each case, over the expiring Subscription Term. Any introductory or temporary discount offered in a previous Subscription Term does not apply to renewals.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order Form by providing written notice to the other Party if the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan. This Agreement shall automatically terminate if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement and without limiting a Party’s obligations under Section 7(c), Customer shall cease all use of the Services, and Jasper shall provide Customer with a copy of all Inputs and Outputs if requested by Customer in writing within 30 days following termination.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Surviving Provisions</em>. The following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in effect after any such termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3-7, 8(d), 9,  10, 11(d), 11(e), 12, and the Platform Guidelines. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Entire Understanding</em>. This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable) and all Exhibits and Order Forms, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations, and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase orders are hereby rejected, and all such terms and conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the AUP, which shall take effect immediately upon posting, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>. Except as expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid), with an electronic copy sent to legal@jasper.ai. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

If Customer adds additional Services during a Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Fees associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of the then-current Subscription Term and charged to Customer and due and payable in accordance with Section 3(b). If Customer’s usage of the Services exceeds the purchased quantities, Customer will be provided with written notice of such excess usage and five (5) days to reduce its usage to the purchased levels.  To the extent Customer’s usage exceeds the purchased quantities at the end of such period, Customer will be deemed to have executed a Subscription Upgrade with respect to such excess Services and will be invoiced accordingly. In any automatic renewal of the Subscription Term (if applicable), the Fees and quantities will include all prior Subscription Upgrades. Fees are quoted and payable in United States dollars.  Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, payment obligations are non-cancellable and Fees paid are non-refundable.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Invoices and Payment.</em> Jasper will invoice Customer for the charges at the email address on file with Jasper.

Jasper will invoice Customer for Taxes imposed by governmental bodies in the United States. If Jasper is required to directly pay Taxes related to Customer’s use or receipt of any Services, Customer agrees to promptly reimburse Jasper for any amounts paid by Jasper.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intellectual Property Ownership</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Customer Property.</em> As between Customer and Jasper, Customer retains any and all rights, title, and interest in and to the Customer Property, including any and all intellectual property rights embodied in or related to the Customer Property. Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, no right, title, or license under any Customer Property is granted to Jasper or implied hereby.  To the extent that ownership of the Inputs or Outputs does not automatically vest in Customer, Jasper hereby assigns all of its right title and interest in and to the Inputs and Outputs to Customer; provided, however, Customer acknowledges that due to the nature of machine learning, the Output may not be unique and the Services may generate the same or similar output for Jasper or a third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Property.</em> As between Jasper and Customer, Jasper retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Jasper Property, including all intellectual property rights embodied in or related to the Jasper Property. Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, no right, title, or license under any Jasper Property is granted to Customer or implied hereby.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Licenses to Jasper.</em> Customer hereby grants Jasper a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in connection with the permitted assignment of this Agreement), and royalty-free license to access and use the Customer Property solely to provide the Services to Customer pursuant to this Agreement. Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Feedback</em>. By submitting to Jasper any unsolicited suggestions, enhancement requests, comments, or other feedback relating to the Services (“Feedback”), Customer and its Users (as applicable) grant to Jasper a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate such Feedback into the Services in any manner.  For the avoidance of doubt, Feedback excludes all Customer Property.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Usage</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Non-Training of Models</em>. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Jasper shall not use, nor permit a third party to use, Customer Property to train artificial intelligence models utilized by the Service.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>System Performance</em>. Jasper may use data concerning Customer’s or its Users’ use of the Services (“Usage Information”), including but not limited to compiling statistical and performance information related to the operation of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Usage Information excludes all Customer Property.  The foregoing shall not limit, in any way, Jasper’s confidentiality obligations as set forth in Section 7 of the Agreement. Customer agrees that Jasper may make Usage Information publicly available, provided that such use does not identify Customer or any Users either directly or indirectly. Jasper retains all intellectual property rights in Usage Information.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Information Security Requirements</em>. Jasper will maintain an information security program (including the adoption and enforcement of internal policies and procedures) designed to (a) secure the Services and Customer Property against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure, (b) identify reasonably foreseeable and internal risks to security and unauthorized access, and (c) minimize security risks, including through risk assessment and regular testing. As part of this information security program, Jasper shall implement the security measures set forth at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements">legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Hosting and Processing</em>. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by Jasper, Customer Property may be hosted by Jasper or its Affiliates, or their respective authorized third-party service providers, in the United States, the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or the United Kingdom.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Processing of Personal Data</em>. The Parties acknowledge that use of the Service does not require Jasper  to process Personal Data on behalf of Customer.  In other words, Customer acknowledges that it does not need to provide Input that contains Personal Data in order to make effective use of the Services.  However, if Customer wishes to submit Personal Data to Jasper for processing on its behalf, it must first execute a Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) with Jasper, which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#dpa">legal.jasper.ai/#dpa</a>. Upon execution of the DPA by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.  To the extent that Jasper processes Personal Data in its capacity as a data controller, such processing will be in accordance with Jasper’s Privacy Policy which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#privacy">legal.jasper.ai/#privacy</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Third Party Service Providers</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use third party service providers who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of such service providers to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each service provider directly under the terms of this Agreement. A list of all such service providers can be found here: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors">legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In-Product Cookies</em>. Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy, accessible at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#cookies">legal.jasper.ai/#cookies</a>, applies. When Jasper collects this information, it only uses this data to (i) provide the Services, or (ii) in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify the Customers or Users personally.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Confidentiality.</em> During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind, but in no event with less than a reasonable standard of care; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, or agents who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information. This Section shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Destruction of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Warranties.</em> Jasper warrants to Customer that the Services purchased by Customer will, in all material respects, perform in accordance with the applicable portions of the Documentation. As Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of the warranty set forth in this Section 8(b), Jasper will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Services to comply with such warranty without charge. If Jasper is unable to make the Services operate as warranted within thirty (30) days after Customer’s written notice, then Customer or Jasper may terminate this Agreement and/or the applicable Order Form, and Jasper will refund any fees actually paid by Customer (excluding any non-recurring fees) to Jasper for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN ADDITION, JASPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF CUSTOMER PROPERTY STORED BY JASPER.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Beta Services.</em> Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services at its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services will not be provided to Customer or any of its Users unless it expressly opts-in to use such services.  Further, Beta Services are provided “as-is” and not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 8 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 9(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions on Customer’s use of the Services, Jasper’s reservation of rights, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper shall indemnify and defend Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and any outstanding Order Forms and refund to Customer prepaid unused Fees for the infringing items.

Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase orders are hereby rejected, and all such terms and conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the AUP, which shall take effect immediately upon posting, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment.

Except as expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid), with an electronic copy sent to legal@jasper.ai. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

If Customer adds additional Services during a Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Fees associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of the then-current Subscription Term and charged to Customer and due and payable in accordance with Section 3(b). If Customer’s usage of the Services exceeds the purchased quantities, Customer will be provided with written notice of such excess usage and five (5) days to reduce its usage to the purchased levels.

Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, no right, title, or license under any Customer Property is granted to Jasper or implied hereby.  To the extent that ownership of the Inputs or Outputs does not automatically vest in Customer, Jasper hereby assigns all of its right title and interest in and to the Inputs and Outputs to Customer; provided, however, Customer acknowledges that due to the nature of machine learning, the Output may not be unique and the Services may generate the same or similar output for Jasper or a third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Property.</em> As between Jasper and Customer, Jasper retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Jasper Property, including all intellectual property rights embodied in or related to the Jasper Property.

Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Feedback</em>. By submitting to Jasper any unsolicited suggestions, enhancement requests, comments, or other feedback relating to the Services (“Feedback”), Customer and its Users (as applicable) grant to Jasper a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate such Feedback into the Services in any manner.  For the avoidance of doubt, Feedback excludes all Customer Property.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Usage</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Non-Training of Models</em>. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Jasper shall not use, nor permit a third party to use, Customer Property to train artificial intelligence models utilized by the Service.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>System Performance</em>. Jasper may use data concerning Customer’s or its Users’ use of the Services (“Usage Information”), including but not limited to compiling statistical and performance information related to the operation of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Usage Information excludes all Customer Property.  The foregoing shall not limit, in any way, Jasper’s confidentiality obligations as set forth in Section 7 of the Agreement. Customer agrees that Jasper may make Usage Information publicly available, provided that such use does not identify Customer or any Users either directly or indirectly. Jasper retains all intellectual property rights in Usage Information.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Information Security Requirements</em>.

The Parties acknowledge that use of the Service does not require Jasper  to process Personal Data on behalf of Customer.  In other words, Customer acknowledges that it does not need to provide Input that contains Personal Data in order to make effective use of the Services.  However, if Customer wishes to submit Personal Data to Jasper for processing on its behalf, it must first execute a Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) with Jasper, which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#dpa">legal.jasper.ai/#dpa</a>. Upon execution of the DPA by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.  To the extent that Jasper processes Personal Data in its capacity as a data controller, such processing will be in accordance with Jasper’s Privacy Policy which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#privacy">legal.jasper.ai/#privacy</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Third Party Service Providers</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use third party service providers who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of such service providers to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each service provider directly under the terms of this Agreement. A list of all such service providers can be found here: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors">legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In-Product Cookies</em>. Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy, accessible at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#cookies">legal.jasper.ai/#cookies</a>, applies. When Jasper collects this information, it only uses this data to (i) provide the Services, or (ii) in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify the Customers or Users personally.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Confidentiality.</em> During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind, but in no event with less than a reasonable standard of care; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, or agents who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information. This Section shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Destruction of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>.

As Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of the warranty set forth in this Section 8(b), Jasper will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Services to comply with such warranty without charge. If Jasper is unable to make the Services operate as warranted within thirty (30) days after Customer’s written notice, then Customer or Jasper may terminate this Agreement and/or the applicable Order Form, and Jasper will refund any fees actually paid by Customer (excluding any non-recurring fees) to Jasper for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This Agreement shall automatically terminate if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement and without limiting a Party’s obligations under Section 7(c), Customer shall cease all use of the Services, and Jasper shall provide Customer with a copy of all Inputs and Outputs if requested by Customer in writing within 30 days following termination.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Surviving Provisions</em>.

To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase orders are hereby rejected, and all such terms and conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the AUP, which shall take effect immediately upon posting, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment.

Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>. Except as expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid), with an electronic copy sent to legal@jasper.ai. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

In other words, Customer acknowledges that it does not need to provide Input that contains Personal Data in order to make effective use of the Services.  However, if Customer wishes to submit Personal Data to Jasper for processing on its behalf, it must first execute a Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) with Jasper, which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#dpa">legal.jasper.ai/#dpa</a>. Upon execution of the DPA by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.

Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use third party service providers who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of such service providers to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each service provider directly under the terms of this Agreement.

This Section shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Destruction of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>.

As Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of the warranty set forth in this Section 8(b), Jasper will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Services to comply with such warranty without charge. If Jasper is unable to make the Services operate as warranted within thirty (30) days after Customer’s written notice, then Customer or Jasper may terminate this Agreement and/or the applicable Order Form, and Jasper will refund any fees actually paid by Customer (excluding any non-recurring fees) to Jasper for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN ADDITION, JASPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF CUSTOMER PROPERTY STORED BY JASPER.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Beta Services.</em> Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services at its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services will not be provided to Customer or any of its Users unless it expressly opts-in to use such services.  Further, Beta Services are provided “as-is” and not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 8 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 9(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions on Customer’s use of the Services, Jasper’s reservation of rights, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper shall indemnify and defend Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”).

The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusion of Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

This Agreement shall automatically terminate if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement and without limiting a Party’s obligations under Section 7(c), Customer shall cease all use of the Services, and Jasper shall provide Customer with a copy of all Inputs and Outputs if requested by Customer in writing within 30 days following termination.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Surviving Provisions</em>.

Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase orders are hereby rejected, and all such terms and conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the AUP, which shall take effect immediately upon posting, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, no right, title, or license under any Jasper Property is granted to Customer or implied hereby.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Licenses to Jasper.</em> Customer hereby grants Jasper a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in connection with the permitted assignment of this Agreement), and royalty-free license to access and use the Customer Property solely to provide the Services to Customer pursuant to this Agreement. Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Feedback</em>. By submitting to Jasper any unsolicited suggestions, enhancement requests, comments, or other feedback relating to the Services (“Feedback”), Customer and its Users (as applicable) grant to Jasper a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate such Feedback into the Services in any manner.  For the avoidance of doubt, Feedback excludes all Customer Property.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Usage</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Non-Training of Models</em>. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, Jasper shall not use, nor permit a third party to use, Customer Property to train artificial intelligence models utilized by the Service.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>System Performance</em>. Jasper may use data concerning Customer’s or its Users’ use of the Services (“Usage Information”), including but not limited to compiling statistical and performance information related to the operation of the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, Usage Information excludes all Customer Property.  The foregoing shall not limit, in any way, Jasper’s confidentiality obligations as set forth in Section 7 of the Agreement. Customer agrees that Jasper may make Usage Information publicly available, provided that such use does not identify Customer or any Users either directly or indirectly. Jasper retains all intellectual property rights in Usage Information.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Information Security Requirements</em>. Jasper will maintain an information security program (including the adoption and enforcement of internal policies and procedures) designed to (a) secure the Services and Customer Property against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure, (b) identify reasonably foreseeable and internal risks to security and unauthorized access, and (c) minimize security risks, including through risk assessment and regular testing. As part of this information security program, Jasper shall implement the security measures set forth at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements">legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Hosting and Processing</em>. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by Jasper, Customer Property may be hosted by Jasper or its Affiliates, or their respective authorized third-party service providers, in the United States, the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or the United Kingdom.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"> <em>Processing of Personal Data</em>. The Parties acknowledge that use of the Service does not require Jasper  to process Personal Data on behalf of Customer.  In other words, Customer acknowledges that it does not need to provide Input that contains Personal Data in order to make effective use of the Services.  However, if Customer wishes to submit Personal Data to Jasper for processing on its behalf, it must first execute a Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) with Jasper, which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#dpa">legal.jasper.ai/#dpa</a>. Upon execution of the DPA by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.  To the extent that Jasper processes Personal Data in its capacity as a data controller, such processing will be in accordance with Jasper’s Privacy Policy which is accessible at: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#privacy">legal.jasper.ai/#privacy</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Third Party Service Providers</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use third party service providers who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of such service providers to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each service provider directly under the terms of this Agreement. A list of all such service providers can be found here: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors">legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In-Product Cookies</em>. Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy, accessible at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#cookies">legal.jasper.ai/#cookies</a>, applies. When Jasper collects this information, it only uses this data to (i) provide the Services, or (ii) in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify the Customers or Users personally.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Confidentiality.</em> During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind, but in no event with less than a reasonable standard of care; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, or agents who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information. This Section shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Destruction of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Warranties.</em> Jasper warrants to Customer that the Services purchased by Customer will, in all material respects, perform in accordance with the applicable portions of the Documentation. As Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of the warranty set forth in this Section 8(b), Jasper will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the Services to comply with such warranty without charge. If Jasper is unable to make the Services operate as warranted within thirty (30) days after Customer’s written notice, then Customer or Jasper may terminate this Agreement and/or the applicable Order Form, and Jasper will refund any fees actually paid by Customer (excluding any non-recurring fees) to Jasper for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN ADDITION, JASPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF CUSTOMER PROPERTY STORED BY JASPER.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Beta Services.</em> Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services at its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services will not be provided to Customer or any of its Users unless it expressly opts-in to use such services.  Further, Beta Services are provided “as-is” and not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 8 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 9(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions on Customer’s use of the Services, Jasper’s reservation of rights, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper shall indemnify and defend Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and any outstanding Order Forms and refund to Customer prepaid unused Fees for the infringing items. Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from: (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network, or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); or (4) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer shall indemnify and defend Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark, publicity, trade secret or other intellectual property , publicity or privacy right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of Sections 3, 4, and 5 of the Platform Guidelines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification Conditions. </em>The Parties’ obligations under this Section are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusion of Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE, OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cap on Monetary Liability.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY AND PAYABLE FROM CUSTOMER HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE (THE “BASE CAP”). THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF A PARTY’S REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusions</em>. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO A PARTY’S LIABILITY ARISING FROM ITS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN SECTION 8 OR ITS BREACH OF SECTIONS 5 (DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY) OR 6 (CONFIDENTIALITY) OR THE DPA (COLLECTIVELY, THE “EXCLUSIONS”); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, A PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE EXCCLUSIONS WILL NOT EXCEED THREE TIMES (3X) THE BASE CAP.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Term and Termination</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Agreement.</em> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with Section 10(c).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Subscriptions.</em> Customer’s access to the purchased Services shall commence on the start date specified in the relevant Order Form and continue for the Subscription Term specified on such Order Form. At the expiration of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Term for all purchased services will automatically renew for the same period as the renewing Subscription Term, unless either Party elects to not renew by notifying the other Party in writing at least 30 days before such renewal. Except as otherwise specified in a written notice sent to Customer at least 30 days prior to a renewal and only to the extent an Order From automatically renews, Jasper’s per-unit pricing for any renewal of the Subscription Term in such Order From shall not increase by more than the greater of (i) five percent (5%) per year, and (ii) the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in each case, over the expiring Subscription Term. Any introductory or temporary discount offered in a previous Subscription Term does not apply to renewals.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order Form by providing written notice to the other Party if the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan. This Agreement shall automatically terminate if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement and without limiting a Party’s obligations under Section 7(c), Customer shall cease all use of the Services, and Jasper shall provide Customer with a copy of all Inputs and Outputs if requested by Customer in writing within 30 days following termination.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Surviving Provisions</em>. The following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in effect after any such termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3-7, 8(d), 9,  10, 11(d), 11(e), 12, and the Platform Guidelines. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Entire Understanding</em>.

To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase orders are hereby rejected, and all such terms and conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the AUP, which shall take effect immediately upon posting, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>. Except as expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid), with an electronic copy sent to legal@jasper.ai. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion.

To the extent that Personal Data within the Customer Property originates from a User or End-User in the EEA, as further described in the DPA<strong>,</strong> Jasper will ensure that, pursuant to (i) the EU Regulation 2016/679 and any applicable national laws made under it; and (ii) the Swiss Federal Act of 19 June 1992 on Data Protection (as may be amended or superseded), if Personal Data within Customer Property is transferred to a country or territory outside of the EEA (a “non-EEA country”), then such transfer will only take place if: (i) the non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection based on a decision by the European Commission; (ii) one of the conditions listed in Article 46 or 49 of the GDPR (or its equivalent under any successor legislation) is satisfied; or (iii) the Personal Data is transferred on the basis of standard contractual clauses.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Information Security Requirements. </em>Jasper will maintain an information security program (including the adoption and enforcement of internal policies and procedures) designed to (a) secure the Services and Customer Property against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure, (b) identify reasonably foreseeable and internal risks to security and unauthorized access, and (c) minimize security risks, including through risk assessment and regular testing.

This Section 6 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Return of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, (x) Jasper, as Receiving Party, shall not be required to delete any Customer Confidential Information that is licensed to Jasper pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) so long as it is aggregated and de-identified so that it cannot identify Customer or its Users; and (y) the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section 6, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties; Disclaimers</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Warranties.</em> Jasper warrants to Customer that the Services purchased by Customer will, in all material respects, perform in accordance with the applicable portions of the Documentation. This warranty shall not apply to non-conformities, errors, or problems caused by acts within the control of Customer or any of its Users, or arising from Customer’s negligence or improper use of the Services, from unauthorized modifications made to the Services, from use of the Services in an unsupported operating environment or manner, or that arises from Customer’s or any third party’s software or systems (including Third Party Products).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Customer Warranties.</em> Customer warrants that it will not use the Services for unlawful purposes or in a manner that infringes or otherwise violates the rights of any third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND (4) JASPER’S LIABILITY UNDER ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY WHICH CANNOT BE LEGALLY EXCLUDED IS LIMITED IN RESPECT OF THE SERVICES TO SUPPLYING THE SERVICES AGAIN OR PAYING THE COST OF SUPPLYING THE SERVICES AGAIN. IN ADDITION, JASPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF CUSTOMER PROPERTY STORED BY JASPER. CUSTOMER AGREES TO MAINTAIN A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COPY OF ALL CUSTOMER PROPERTY IN A LOCATION INDEPENDENT OF THE SERVICES.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Beta Services.</em> Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services at its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services are not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 7 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 8(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions, Jasper’s reservation of rights, Customer’s obligations concerning the Services, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date otherwise specified in writing by Jasper. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Beta Services are provided “AS IS'' with no express or implied warranty and are outside the scope of Jasper’s indemnification obligations.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and any outstanding Order Forms and refund to Customer prepaid unused Fees for the infringing items. Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from: (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network, or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); or (4) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property or Customer’s use of the Services beyond the license granted in this Agreement infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of the Platform Guidelines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification Conditions.</em> The Parties’ obligations under this Section 8 are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 8, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 8 are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusion of Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE, OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cap on Monetary Liability.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY AND AMOUNTS ACCRUED BUT NOT YET PAID FROM CUSTOMER HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF A PARTY’S REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exceptions</em>. The exclusions and limitations in Section 9(a) and 9(b) do not apply to (i) the Parties’ obligations under Section 6 (Confidentiality) or Section 8 (Indemnification), (ii) liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (iii) liability for Customer’s (1) breach of its payment obligations hereunder, (2) use of the Services in violation of this Agreement, or (3) infringement of Jasper’s intellectual property rights in the Services.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Term and Termination</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Agreement.</em> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with Section 10(c).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Subscriptions.</em> Customer’s access to the purchased Services shall commence on the start date specified in the relevant Order Form and continue for the Subscription Term specified on such Order Form. At the expiration of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Term for all purchased Services will automatically renew for the same duration as the Subscription Term, unless either Party elects not to renew by notifying the other Party in writing at least 60 days before such renewal (or at anytime before the renewal date, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription). Except as otherwise specified in a written notice sent to Customer at least 60 days prior to a renewal (or 30 days, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription), Jasper’s per-unit pricing for any renewal Subscription Term shall not increase by more than the greater of (i) five percent (5%) or (ii) the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in each case, over the renewing Subscription Term. Any introductory or temporary discount offered in a previous Subscription Term does not apply for a renewal Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing caps on price increases shall not apply to renewals in which a Customer transitions from a month-to-month subscription to a longer subscription.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order Form by providing written notice to the other Party if the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan. This Agreement shall automatically terminate if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Customer shall cease all use of the Services.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Surviving Provisions</em>. The following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in effect after any such termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7(d), 8, 9, 10(d), 10(e), 11, and the Platform Guidelines. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Entire Understanding</em>. This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable), the Platform Guidelines, the Information Security Requirements, and Order Forms, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations, and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase order or in any other ordering documentation (excluding Order Forms) are hereby rejected. Such terms will not be deemed incorporated into or form any part of this Agreement, and all such terms or conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the Documentation or the Service, or any policies as necessary to comply with applicable law, rules, and regulations, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party, which consent (1) may not be unreasonably withheld, and (2) will be deemed to have been given if the other Party fails to respond to the requesting Party’s written notice of intent to assign within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>. Except for notification methods expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Export Control</em>. The Service and related technical data and services (collectively, "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations and will not export or re-export any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S. law, nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. All Controlled Technology is generally prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and any other country subject to relevant trade sanctions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

If Customer adds additional Services during a Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Fees associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of the then-current Subscription Term and charged to Customer and due and payable in accordance with Section 3(b).

For all purchased Services, the Payment Method will be charged at the interval indicated in the applicable Order Form.

If Jasper is required to directly pay Taxes related to Customer’s use or receipt of any Services, Customer agrees to promptly reimburse Jasper for any amounts paid by Jasper.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Credits.</em> Jasper may, at its sole discretion, choose to offer credits for the Services in various ways, including but not limited to, coupons, promotional campaigns, and referrals for Jasper’s services such as training. Jasper reserves the right to award credits at its sole discretion. Credits have no monetary or cash value and can only be used by Customer to offset Customer’s subsequent payments of Fees for the Services. Credits may only be applied to Fees due for the Services specifically identified by Jasper when issuing the credit. Credits can only be used by Customer and are non-transferable. To the extent that Customer has been awarded credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the credit was issued.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Free Trials</em>.

Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion.

Upon execution of an Order Form by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Subprocessors.</em> Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use Subprocessors, who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each Subprocessor directly under the terms of this Agreement. A list of all Subprocessors can be found here: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors">legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In-Product Cookies.</em> Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy applies. When Jasper collects this information, it only uses this data to (i) provide the Services, or (ii) in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify the Customers or Users personally.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Information Security Requirements. </em>Jasper will maintain an information security program (including the adoption and enforcement of internal policies and procedures) designed to (a) secure the Services and Customer Property against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure, (b) identify reasonably foreseeable and internal risks to security and unauthorized access, and (c) minimize security risks, including through risk assessment and regular testing. As part of this information security program, Jasper shall implement the security measures available at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements">legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements</a>.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Confidentiality.</em> During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, agents or prospective financing sources or acquirers who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information. This Section 6 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Return of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, (x) Jasper, as Receiving Party, shall not be required to delete any Customer Confidential Information that is licensed to Jasper pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) so long as it is aggregated and de-identified so that it cannot identify Customer or its Users; and (y) the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section 6, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties; Disclaimers</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Warranties.</em> Jasper warrants to Customer that the Services purchased by Customer will, in all material respects, perform in accordance with the applicable portions of the Documentation. This warranty shall not apply to non-conformities, errors, or problems caused by acts within the control of Customer or any of its Users, or arising from Customer’s negligence or improper use of the Services, from unauthorized modifications made to the Services, from use of the Services in an unsupported operating environment or manner, or that arises from Customer’s or any third party’s software or systems (including Third Party Products).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Customer Warranties.</em> Customer warrants that it will not use the Services for unlawful purposes or in a manner that infringes or otherwise violates the rights of any third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND (4) JASPER’S LIABILITY UNDER ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY WHICH CANNOT BE LEGALLY EXCLUDED IS LIMITED IN RESPECT OF THE SERVICES TO SUPPLYING THE SERVICES AGAIN OR PAYING THE COST OF SUPPLYING THE SERVICES AGAIN.

CUSTOMER AGREES TO MAINTAIN A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COPY OF ALL CUSTOMER PROPERTY IN A LOCATION INDEPENDENT OF THE SERVICES.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Beta Services.</em> Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services at its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services are not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 7 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 8(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions, Jasper’s reservation of rights, Customer’s obligations concerning the Services, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date otherwise specified in writing by Jasper. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Beta Services are provided “AS IS'' with no express or implied warranty and are outside the scope of Jasper’s indemnification obligations.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and any outstanding Order Forms and refund to Customer prepaid unused Fees for the infringing items. Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from: (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network, or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); (4) the Output; or (5) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property or Customer’s use of the Services beyond the license granted in this Agreement infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of the Platform Guidelines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification Conditions.</em> The Parties’ obligations under this Section 8 are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 8, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 8 are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusion of Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE, OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cap on Monetary Liability.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY AND AMOUNTS ACCRUED BUT NOT YET PAID FROM CUSTOMER HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF A PARTY’S REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exceptions</em>. The exclusions and limitations in Section 9(a) and 9(b) do not apply to (i) the Parties’ obligations under Section 6 (Confidentiality) or Section 8 (Indemnification), (ii) liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (iii) liability for Customer’s (1) breach of its payment obligations hereunder, (2) use of the Services in violation of this Agreement, or (3) infringement of Jasper’s intellectual property rights in the Services.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Term and Termination</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Agreement.</em> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with Section 10(c).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Subscriptions.</em> Customer’s access to the purchased Services shall commence on the start date specified in the relevant Order Form and continue for the Subscription Term specified on such Order Form. At the expiration of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Term for all purchased Services will automatically renew for the same duration as the Subscription Term, unless either Party elects not to renew by notifying the other Party in writing at least 60 days before such renewal (or at anytime before the renewal date, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription). Except as otherwise specified in a written notice sent to Customer at least 60 days prior to a renewal (or 30 days, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription), Jasper’s per-unit pricing for any renewal Subscription Term shall not increase by more than the greater of (i) five percent (5%) or (ii) the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in each case, over the renewing Subscription Term. Any introductory or temporary discount offered in a previous Subscription Term does not apply for a renewal Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing caps on price increases shall not apply to renewals in which a Customer transitions from a month-to-month subscription to a longer subscription.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order Form by providing written notice to the other Party if the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice, and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan. This Agreement shall automatically terminate if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Customer shall cease all use of the Services.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Surviving Provisions</em>. The following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in effect after any such termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7(d), 8, 9, 10(d), 10(e), 11, and the Platform Guidelines. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Entire Understanding</em>. This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable), the Platform Guidelines, the Information Security Requirements, and Order Forms, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations, and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase order or in any other ordering documentation (excluding Order Forms) are hereby rejected. Such terms will not be deemed incorporated into or form any part of this Agreement, and all such terms or conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the Documentation or the Service, or any policies as necessary to comply with applicable law, rules, and regulations, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party, which consent (1) may not be unreasonably withheld, and (2) will be deemed to have been given if the other Party fails to respond to the requesting Party’s written notice of intent to assign within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>.

If Customer adds additional Services during a Subscription Term (a “Subscription Upgrade”), any incremental Fees associated with such Subscription Upgrade will be prorated over the remaining period of the then-current Subscription Term and charged to Customer and due and payable in accordance with Section 3(b). In addition, unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, Customer will be deemed to have executed a Subscription Upgrade with Jasper if its usage of the Services exceeds the previously purchased usage levels.

For all purchased Services, the Payment Method will be charged on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in the applicable Order Form. If Jasper does not collect a Payment Method from Customer at the time of purchase, Jasper will invoice Customer for the charges at the email address on file with Jasper. Customer will pay all invoiced amounts within thirty (30) calendar days of the invoice date. Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form, Customer will pay all Fees on an annual, prepaid basis. Overdue invoices are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Taxes.</em> Customer is solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, assessments, tariffs, duties, or other fees imposed, assessed, or collected by or under the authority of any governmental body arising from Jasper’s provision of the Services hereunder (collectively, “Taxes”), except any taxes assessed upon Jasper’s net income. If Jasper is required to directly pay Taxes related to Customer’s use or receipt of any Services, Customer agrees to promptly reimburse Jasper for any amounts paid by Jasper.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Credits.</em> Jasper may, at its sole discretion, choose to offer credits for the Services in various ways, including but not limited to, coupons, promotional campaigns, and referrals for Jasper’s services such as training. Jasper reserves the right to award credits at its sole discretion. Credits have no monetary or cash value and can only be used by Customer to offset Customer’s subsequent payments of Fees for the Services. Credits may only be applied to Fees due for the Services specifically identified by Jasper when issuing the credit. Credits can only be used by Customer and are non-transferable. To the extent that Customer has been awarded credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the credit was issued.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Free Trials</em>.  Jasper or its third-party service providers may offer free trials to a particular Service. Jasper or its third-party service provider may automatically bill Customer's payment method on the later of the day Customer's free trial ends or the day Customer starts its paid subscription, and on each recurring billing date thereafter, subject to Section 3(f). Customer may not receive a notice that its free trial has ended and that payment for its subscription is due.

If Customer cancels its subscription during a free trial, cancellation may be effective immediately.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Automatic Renewal of Subscription Fees</em>. IF CUSTOMER SIGNS UP FOR A SUBSCRIPTION, THE CORRESPONDING FEES AT THE RATE AS SET FORTH IN CUSTOMER'S USER ACCOUNT AND/OR ON THE CHECKOUT PAGE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW EVERY MONTH ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS UNLESS AND UNTIL CUSTOMER NOTIFIES JASPER THAT IT WANTS TO CANCEL ITS SUBSCRIPTION. ANY NOTICE OF CANCELLATION MUST BE SUBMITTED ON CUSTOMER'S SETTINGS PAGE OR IN WRITING AND SENT TO HEY@JASPER.AI AND WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN THE MONTH FOLLOWING THE MONTH CUSTOMER PROVIDES JASPER NOTICE. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT UNLESS AND UNTIL IT NOTIFiES JASPER OF CUSTOMER'S CANCELLATION, CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION AND ALL CORRESPONDING FEES WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, AND IT AUTHORIZES JASPER OR JASPER'S AUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROVIDER (WITHOUT NOTICE TO CUSTOMER, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO CHARGE CUSTOMER THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD JASPER HAS ON RECORD FOR CUSTOMER.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intellectual Property Ownership</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Customer Property.</em> As between Customer and Jasper, Customer retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Customer Property, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights embodied in or related to the Customer Property.

Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that, Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion. By submitting to Jasper any unsolicited suggestions, enhancement requests, comments, feedback, or other input relating to the Services ("Feedback"), Customer and its Users (as applicable) grant to Jasper a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate such Feedback into the Services in any manner.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Hosting and Processing.</em> Unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by Jasper, Customer Property may be hosted by Jasper or its Affiliates, or their respective authorized third-party service providers, in the United States, the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or the United Kingdom.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Transfer of Personal Data.</em> To the extent that Personal Data within the Customer Property originates from a User or End-User in the EEA, as further described in the DPA<strong>,</strong> Jasper will ensure that, pursuant to (i) the EU Regulation 2016/679 and any applicable national laws made under it; and (ii) the Swiss Federal Act of 19 June 1992 on Data Protection (as may be amended or superseded), if Personal Data within Customer Property is transferred to a country or territory outside of the EEA (a “non-EEA country”), then such transfer will only take place if: (i) the non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection based on a decision by the European Commission; (ii) one of the conditions listed in Article 46 or 49 of the GDPR (or its equivalent under any successor legislation) is satisfied; or (iii) the Personal Data is transferred on the basis of standard contractual clauses.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Data Processing Agreement. </em>The Data Processing Agreement with Jasper (“DPA”) is accessible for review at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#dpa">legal.jasper.ai/#dpa</a>. Upon execution of an Order Form by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Subprocessors.</em> Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use Subprocessors, who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each Subprocessor directly under the terms of this Agreement. A list of all Subprocessors can be found here: <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors">legal.jasper.ai/#sub-processors</a>.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In-Product Cookies.</em> Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy applies.

As part of this information security program, Jasper shall implement the security measures available at <a href="https://legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements">legal.jasper.ai/#security-requirements</a>.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Confidentiality.</em> During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, agents or prospective financing sources or acquirers who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information. This Section 6 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Return of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, (x) Jasper, as Receiving Party, shall not be required to delete any Customer Confidential Information that is licensed to Jasper pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) so long as it is aggregated and de-identified so that it cannot identify Customer or its Users; and (y) the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section 6, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties; Disclaimers</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>.

Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date otherwise specified in writing by Jasper. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available.

Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from: (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network, or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); (4) the Output; or (5) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property or Customer’s use of the Services beyond the license granted in this Agreement infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of the Platform Guidelines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification Conditions.</em> The Parties’ obligations under this Section 8 are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 8, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 8 are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusion of Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

The exclusions and limitations in Section 9(a) and 9(b) do not apply to (i) the Parties’ obligations under Section 6 (Confidentiality) or Section 8 (Indemnification), (ii) liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (iii) liability for Customer’s (1) breach of its payment obligations hereunder, (2) use of the Services in violation of this Agreement, or (3) infringement of Jasper’s intellectual property rights in the Services.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Term and Termination</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Agreement.</em> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with Section 10(c).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Subscriptions.</em> Customer’s access to the purchased Services shall commence on the start date specified in the relevant Order Form and continue for the Subscription Term specified on such Order Form. At the expiration of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Term for all purchased Services will automatically renew for the same period as the renewing Subscription Term, unless either Party elects to not renew by notifying the other Party in writing at least 60 days before such renewal (or at anytime before the renewal date, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription). Except as otherwise specified in a written notice sent to Customer at least 60 days prior to a renewal (or 30 days, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription), Jasper’s per-unit pricing for any renewal Subscription Term shall not increase by more than the greater of (i) five percent (5%) or (ii) the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in each case, over the renewing Subscription Term. Any introductory or temporary discount offered in a previous Subscription Term does not apply for a renewal Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing caps on price increases shall not apply to renewals in which a Customer is transitioning from a month-to-month subscription to a longer subscription.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order Form by providing written notice to the other Party in the event the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan. In addition, a Party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other Party if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Customer shall cease all use of the Services.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Surviving Provisions</em>. The following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in effect after any such termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7(d), 8, 9, 10(d), 10(e), 11, and the Platform Guidelines. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Entire Understanding</em>. This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable), the Platform Guidelines, the Information Security Requirements, and Order Forms, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations, and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase order or in any other ordering documentation (excluding Order Forms) are hereby rejected. Such terms will not be deemed incorporated into or form any part of this Agreement, and all such terms or conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the Documentation or the Service, or any policies as necessary to comply with applicable law, rules, and regulations, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party, which consent (1) may not be unreasonably withheld, and (2) will be deemed to have been given if the other Party fails to respond to the requesting Party’s written notice of intent to assign within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>. Except for notification methods expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Export Control</em>. The Service and related technical data and services (collectively, "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations and will not export or re-export any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S. law, nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. All Controlled Technology is generally prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and any other country subject to relevant trade sanctions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

If Jasper is required to directly pay Taxes related to Customer’s use or receipt of any Services, Customer agrees to promptly reimburse Jasper for any amounts paid by Jasper.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Credits.</em> Jasper may, at its sole discretion, choose to offer credits for the Services in various ways, including but not limited to, coupons, promotional campaigns, and referrals for Jasper’s services such as training. Jasper reserves the right to award credits at its sole discretion. Credits have no monetary or cash value and can only be used by Customer to offset Customer’s subsequent payments of Fees for the Services. Credits may only be applied to Fees due for the Services specifically identified by Jasper when issuing the credit. Credits can only be used by Customer and are non-transferable. To the extent that Customer has been awarded credits, unless the instrument (including any coupon) states an earlier expiration date, credits shall expire and no longer be redeemable twelve (12) months from the date the credit was issued.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Free Trials</em>.  Jasper or its third-party service providers may offer free trials to a particular Service. Jasper or its third-party service provider may automatically bill Customer's payment method on the later of the day Customer's free trial ends or the day Customer starts its paid subscription, and on each recurring billing date thereafter, subject to Section 3(f). Customer may not receive a notice that its free trial has ended and that payment for its subscription is due.

ANY NOTICE OF CANCELLATION MUST BE SUBMITTED ON CUSTOMER'S SETTINGS PAGE OR IN WRITING AND SENT TO HEY@JASPER.AI AND WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN THE MONTH FOLLOWING THE MONTH CUSTOMER PROVIDES JASPER NOTICE. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT UNLESS AND UNTIL IT NOTIFiES JASPER OF CUSTOMER'S CANCELLATION, CUSTOMER'S SUBSCRIPTION AND ALL CORRESPONDING FEES WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, AND IT AUTHORIZES JASPER OR JASPER'S AUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROVIDER (WITHOUT NOTICE TO CUSTOMER, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO CHARGE CUSTOMER THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD JASPER HAS ON RECORD FOR CUSTOMER.</li></ol></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Intellectual Property Ownership</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Customer Property.</em> As between Customer and Jasper, Customer retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Customer Property, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights embodied in or related to the Customer Property.

Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that, Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion. By submitting to Jasper any unsolicited suggestions, enhancement requests, comments, feedback, or other input relating to the Services ("Feedback"), Customer and its Users (as applicable) grant to Jasper a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate such Feedback into the Services in any manner.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Hosting and Processing.</em> Unless otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by Jasper, Customer Property may be hosted by Jasper or its Affiliates, or their respective authorized third-party service providers, in the United States, the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or the United Kingdom.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Transfer of Personal Data.</em> To the extent that Personal Data within the Customer Property originates from a User or End-User in the EEA, as further described in the DPA<strong>,</strong> Jasper will ensure that, pursuant to (i) the EU Regulation 2016/679 and any applicable national laws made under it; and (ii) the Swiss Federal Act of 19 June 1992 on Data Protection (as may be amended or superseded), if Personal Data within Customer Property is transferred to a country or territory outside of the EEA (a “non-EEA country”), then such transfer will only take place if: (i) the non-EEA country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection based on a decision by the European Commission; (ii) one of the conditions listed in Article 46 or 49 of the GDPR (or its equivalent under any successor legislation) is satisfied; or (iii) the Personal Data is transferred on the basis of standard contractual clauses.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Data Processing Agreement. </em>The Data Processing Agreement with Jasper (“DPA”) is accessible for review at jasper.ai/legal/dpa. Upon execution of an Order Form by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Subprocessors.</em> Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use Subprocessors, who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each Subprocessor directly under the terms of this Agreement. A list of all Subprocessors can be found here: https://www.jasper.ai/legal/sub-processors.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In-Product Cookies.</em> Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy applies. When Jasper collects this information, it only uses this data to (i) provide the Services, or (ii) in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify the Customers or Users personally.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Information Security Requirements. </em>Jasper will maintain an information security program (including the adoption and enforcement of internal policies and procedures) designed to (a) secure the Services and Customer Property against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure, (b) identify reasonably foreseeable and internal risks to security and unauthorized access, and (c) minimize security risks, including through risk assessment and regular testing.

All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section 6, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties; Disclaimers</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Warranties.</em> Jasper warrants to Customer that the Services purchased by Customer will, in all material respects, perform in accordance with the applicable portions of the Documentation. This warranty shall not apply to non-conformities, errors, or problems caused by acts within the control of Customer or any of its Users, or arising from Customer’s negligence or improper use of the Services, from unauthorized modifications made to the Services, from use of the Services in an unsupported operating environment or manner, or that arises from Customer’s or any third party’s software or systems (including Third Party Products).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Customer Warranties.</em> Customer warrants that it will not use the Services for unlawful purposes or in a manner that infringes or otherwise violates the rights of any third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND (4) JASPER’S LIABILITY UNDER ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY WHICH CANNOT BE LEGALLY EXCLUDED IS LIMITED IN RESPECT OF THE SERVICES TO SUPPLYING THE SERVICES AGAIN OR PAYING THE COST OF SUPPLYING THE SERVICES AGAIN. IN ADDITION, JASPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF CUSTOMER PROPERTY STORED BY JASPER. CUSTOMER AGREES TO MAINTAIN A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COPY OF ALL CUSTOMER PROPERTY IN A LOCATION INDEPENDENT OF THE SERVICES.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Beta Services.</em> Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services at its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services are not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 7 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 8(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions, Jasper’s reservation of rights, Customer’s obligations concerning the Services, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date otherwise specified in writing by Jasper. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Beta Services are provided “AS IS'' with no express or implied warranty and are outside the scope of Jasper’s indemnification obligations.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and any outstanding Order Forms and refund to Customer prepaid unused Fees for the infringing items. Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from: (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network, or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); (4) the Output; or (5) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property or Customer’s use of the Services beyond the license granted in this Agreement infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of the Platform Guidelines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification Conditions.</em> The Parties’ obligations under this Section 8 are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 8, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 8 are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusion of Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE, OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cap on Monetary Liability.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY AND AMOUNTS ACCRUED BUT NOT YET PAID FROM CUSTOMER HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.

The exclusions and limitations in Section 9(a) and 9(b) do not apply to (i) the Parties’ obligations under Section 6 (Confidentiality) or Section 8 (Indemnification), (ii) liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (iii) liability for Customer’s (1) breach of its payment obligations hereunder, (2) use of the Services in violation of this Agreement, or (3) infringement of Jasper’s intellectual property rights in the Services.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Term and Termination</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Agreement.</em> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with Section 10(c).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Subscriptions.</em> Customer’s access to the purchased Services shall commence on the start date specified in the relevant Order Form and continue for the Subscription Term specified on such Order Form. At the expiration of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Term for all purchased Services will automatically renew for the same period as the renewing Subscription Term, unless either Party elects to not renew by notifying the other Party in writing at least 60 days before such renewal (or at anytime before the renewal date, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription). Except as otherwise specified in a written notice sent to Customer at least 60 days prior to a renewal (or 30 days, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription), Jasper’s per-unit pricing for any renewal Subscription Term shall not increase by more than the greater of (i) five percent (5%) or (ii) the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in each case, over the renewing Subscription Term. Any introductory or temporary discount offered in a previous Subscription Term does not apply for a renewal Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing caps on price increases shall not apply to renewals in which a Customer is transitioning from a month-to-month subscription to a longer subscription.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order Form by providing written notice to the other Party in the event the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan. In addition, a Party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other Party if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Customer shall cease all use of the Services.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Surviving Provisions</em>. The following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in effect after any such termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7(d), 8, 9, 10(d), 10(e), 11, and the Platform Guidelines. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Entire Understanding</em>. This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable), the Platform Guidelines, the Information Security Requirements, and Order Forms, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations, and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase order or in any other ordering documentation (excluding Order Forms) are hereby rejected. Such terms will not be deemed incorporated into or form any part of this Agreement, and all such terms or conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the Documentation or the Service, or any policies as necessary to comply with applicable law, rules, and regulations, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party, which consent (1) may not be unreasonably withheld, and (2) will be deemed to have been given if the other Party fails to respond to the requesting Party’s written notice of intent to assign within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>. Except for notification methods expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Export Control</em>. The Service and related technical data and services (collectively, "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations and will not export or re-export any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S. law, nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. All Controlled Technology is generally prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and any other country subject to relevant trade sanctions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

Except as expressly set out in this Agreement, no right, title, or license under any Jasper Property is granted to Customer or implied hereby, and for any Jasper Property that is licensed to Customer, no title or ownership rights are transferred to Customer with such license.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Licenses to Jasper.</em> Customer hereby grants Jasper a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in connection with the permitted assignment of this Agreement or to ), and royalty-free license to access and use the Customer Property made available to Jasper or any of its Affiliates, solely as necessary for Jasper to (i) provide the Services to Customer pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) train the artificial intelligence models developed by Jasper and its third-party service providers to provide the Services, including sharing select portions of Customer Property to third-party contractors (subject to confidentiality and security obligations at least as restrictive as this Agreement, with Jasper being responsible for all actions and omissions of such contractors), provided, however, that such Customer Property used for this purpose must be aggregated and de-identified so that it cannot identify Customer or its Users. Additionally, Customer grants Jasper a non-exclusive, revocable license to use Customer’s trademarks and logos to identify Customer as a subscriber of the Services; provided that, Customer may revoke such consent at any time in its sole discretion. By submitting to Jasper any unsolicited suggestions, enhancement requests, comments, feedback, or other input relating to the Services ("Feedback"), Customer and its Users (as applicable) grant to Jasper a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate such Feedback into the Services in any manner.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>License to Customer</em>.

Upon execution of an Order Form by Customer, the DPA shall be fully incorporated by reference in, and become a part of, this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Subprocessors.</em> Customer acknowledges and agrees that Jasper may use Subprocessors, who may access Customer Property, to provide, secure and improve the Services. Jasper shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of its Subprocessors to the same extent that Jasper would be responsible if Jasper was performing the services of each Subprocessor directly under the terms of this Agreement. A list of all Subprocessors can be found here: https://www.jasper.ai/legal/sub-processors.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>In-Product Cookies.</em> Whenever Customers or Users interact with the Services, Jasper uses First Party Cookies to collect information to ensure Customers and Users can securely, quickly and reliably use the Services, and Jasper’s In-Product Cookie Policy applies. When Jasper collects this information, it only uses this data to (i) provide the Services, or (ii) in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify the Customers or Users personally.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Information Security Requirements. </em>Jasper will maintain an information security program (including the adoption and enforcement of internal policies and procedures) designed to (a) secure the Services and Customer Property against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure, (b) identify reasonably foreseeable and internal risks to security and unauthorized access, and (c) minimize security risks, including through risk assessment and regular testing. As part of this information security program, Jasper shall implement the security measures available at www.jasper.ai/legal/security.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Confidentiality.</em> During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, agents or prospective financing sources or acquirers who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information. This Section 6 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between Customer and Jasper entered prior to the Effective Date that would purport to address the confidentiality of Confidential Information and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to either Party’s Confidential Information.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Compelled Disclosure.</em> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Return of Confidential Information.</em> At any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will destroy all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including all copies thereof and notes and other materials incorporating such Confidential Information, whether in physical or electronic form; provided, however, (x) Jasper, as Receiving Party, shall not be required to delete any Customer Confidential Information that is licensed to Jasper pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) so long as it is aggregated and de-identified so that it cannot identify Customer or its Users; and (y) the Receiving Party shall not be required to return or destroy electronic copies that are automatically stored in accordance with Receiving Party’s generally applicable backup policies and which are not reasonably accessible by the Receiving Party (“Backup Media”). All Backup Media shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement, so long as it remains undeleted.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Remedies.</em> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to disclose or use) any Confidential Information in breach of this Section 6, the Disclosing Party shall have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the Parties that any other available remedies are inadequate.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Warranties; Disclaimers</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mutual Warranties</em>. Each Party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Jasper Warranties.</em> Jasper warrants to Customer that the Services purchased by Customer will, in all material respects, perform in accordance with the applicable portions of the Documentation. This warranty shall not apply to non-conformities, errors, or problems caused by acts within the control of Customer or any of its Users, or arising from Customer’s negligence or improper use of the Services, from unauthorized modifications made to the Services, from use of the Services in an unsupported operating environment or manner, or that arises from Customer’s or any third party’s software or systems (including Third Party Products).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Customer Warranties.</em> Customer warrants that it will not use the Services for unlawful purposes or in a manner that infringes or otherwise violates the rights of any third party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">(d) <em>Disclaimer.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BUT EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, (1) THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS-IS”; (2) NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY OF ANY KIND TO THE OTHER PARTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, (3) EACH PARTY HEREBY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, UNDERTAKINGS AND GUARANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND (4) JASPER’S LIABILITY UNDER ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, UNDERTAKING OR GUARANTY WHICH CANNOT BE LEGALLY EXCLUDED IS LIMITED IN RESPECT OF THE SERVICES TO SUPPLYING THE SERVICES AGAIN OR PAYING THE COST OF SUPPLYING THE SERVICES AGAIN. IN ADDITION, JASPER DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF CUSTOMER PROPERTY STORED BY JASPER. CUSTOMER AGREES TO MAINTAIN A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COPY OF ALL CUSTOMER PROPERTY IN A LOCATION INDEPENDENT OF THE SERVICES.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Beta Services.</em> Jasper may make Beta Services available to Customer at no charge, and Customer may choose to try such Beta Services at its sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services are not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 7 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 8(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions, Jasper’s reservation of rights, Customer’s obligations concerning the Services, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date otherwise specified in writing by Jasper. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Beta Services are provided “AS IS'' with no express or implied warranty and are outside the scope of Jasper’s indemnification obligations.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Indemnification</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper will defend and pay Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and any outstanding Order Forms and refund to Customer prepaid unused Fees for the infringing items. Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from: (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network, or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); (4) the Output; or (5) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer will defend and pay Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property or Customer’s use of the Services beyond the license granted in this Agreement infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of the Platform Guidelines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification Conditions.</em> The Parties’ obligations under this Section 8 are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 8, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 8 are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Limitation of Liability.</em> EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS UNDER SECTIONS 6 AND 8, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY AND AMOUNTS ACCRUED BUT NOT YET PAID FROM CUSTOMER HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF A PARTY’S REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE, OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Term and Termination</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Agreement.</em> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with Section 10(c).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Subscriptions.</em> Customer’s access to the purchased Services shall commence on the start date specified in the relevant Order Form and continue for the Subscription Term specified on such Order Form. At the expiration of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Term for all purchased Services will automatically renew for the same period as the renewing Subscription Term, unless either Party elects to not renew by notifying the other Party in writing at least 60 days before such renewal (or at anytime before the renewal date, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription). Except as otherwise specified in a written notice sent to Customer at least 60 days prior to a renewal (or 30 days, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription), Jasper’s per-unit pricing for any renewal Subscription Term shall not increase by more than the greater of (i) five percent (5%) or (ii) the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in each case, over the renewing Subscription Term. Any introductory or temporary discount offered in a previous Subscription Term does not apply for a renewal Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing caps on price increases shall not apply to renewals in which a Customer is transitioning from a month-to-month subscription to a longer subscription.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order Form by providing written notice to the other Party in the event the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan. In addition, a Party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other Party if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Form. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Customer shall cease all use of the Services.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">(e) <em>Surviving Provisions</em>. The following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in effect after any such termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7(d), 8, 9, 10(d), 10(e), 11, and the Platform Guidelines. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Entire Understanding</em>. This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable), the Platform Guidelines, the Information Security Requirements, and Order Forms, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations, and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase order or in any other ordering documentation (excluding Order Forms) are hereby rejected. Such terms will not be deemed incorporated into or form any part of this Agreement, and all such terms or conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the Documentation or the Service, or any policies as necessary to comply with applicable law, rules, and regulations, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party, which consent (1) may not be unreasonably withheld, and (2) will be deemed to have been given if the other Party fails to respond to the requesting Party’s written notice of intent to assign within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>. Except for notification methods expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Export Control</em>. The Service and related technical data and services (collectively, "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations and will not export or re-export any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S. law, nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. All Controlled Technology is generally prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and any other country subject to relevant trade sanctions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

As part of this information security program, Jasper shall implement the security measures available at www.jasper.ai/legal/security.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Confidentiality.</em> During the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, each Party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the other Party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of a like kind; provided that a Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with Disclosing Party’s consent or to its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, subcontractors, agents or prospective financing sources or acquirers who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who are bound by written agreements requiring the protection of such Confidential Information.

Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to Customer. Beta Services are not considered “Services” under this Agreement for purposes of Section 7 (Warranties; Disclaimer) and Sections 8(a) (Indemnification by Jasper); however, all restrictions, Jasper’s reservation of rights, Customer’s obligations concerning the Services, and Customer’s use of any Third Party Products shall apply equally to Customer’s use of Beta Services. Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date otherwise specified in writing by Jasper. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available.

Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from: (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network, or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); (4) the Output; or (5) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer will defend and pay Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property or Customer’s use of the Services beyond the license granted in this Agreement infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of the Platform Guidelines.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Indemnification Conditions.</em> The Parties’ obligations under this Section 8 are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 8, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 8 are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Limitation of Liability.</em> EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS UNDER SECTIONS 6 AND 8, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY AND AMOUNTS ACCRUED BUT NOT YET PAID FROM CUSTOMER HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE, OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Term and Termination</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Agreement.</em> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with Section 10(c).</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Term of Subscriptions.</em> Customer’s access to the purchased Services shall commence on the start date specified in the relevant Order Form and continue for the Subscription Term specified on such Order Form. At the expiration of each Subscription Term, the Subscription Term for all purchased Services will automatically renew for the same period as the renewing Subscription Term, unless either Party elects to not renew by notifying the other Party in writing at least 60 days before such renewal (or at anytime before the renewal date, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription). Except as otherwise specified in a written notice sent to Customer at least 60 days prior to a renewal (or 30 days, if the expiring Order Form provides for a month-to-month subscription), Jasper’s per-unit pricing for any renewal Subscription Term shall not increase by more than the greater of (i) five percent (5%) or (ii) the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), in each case, over the renewing Subscription Term. Any introductory or temporary discount offered in a previous Subscription Term does not apply for a renewal Subscription Term. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing caps on price increases shall not apply to renewals in which a Customer is transitioning from a month-to-month subscription to a longer subscription.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order Form by providing written notice to the other Party in the event the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan.

Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Entire Understanding</em>. This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable), the Platform Guidelines, the Information Security Requirements, and Order Forms, which are incorporated herein by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations, and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of such Order Form shall prevail. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary therein, all terms and conditions stated in any Customer purchase order or in any other ordering documentation (excluding Order Forms) are hereby rejected. Such terms will not be deemed incorporated into or form any part of this Agreement, and all such terms or conditions are null and void.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Modification; Waiver</em>.

The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party, which consent (1) may not be unreasonably withheld, and (2) will be deemed to have been given if the other Party fails to respond to the requesting Party’s written notice of intent to assign within fourteen (14) days of receipt of such notice; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Notices</em>. Except for notification methods expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any Jasper employees, agent or representative in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Customer will promptly notify Jasper if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for the performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Export Control</em>. The Service and related technical data and services (collectively, "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations and will not export or re-export any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S. law, nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. All Controlled Technology is generally prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and any other country subject to relevant trade sanctions.</li><li style="text-align: justify;"><em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</li></ol></li></ol>

The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment.

All Controlled Technology is generally prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and any other country subject to relevant trade sanctions. </p><p>(l) <em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</p>

Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date otherwise specified in writing by Jasper. Jasper may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Beta Services are provided “AS IS'' with no express or implied warranty and are outside the scope of Jasper’s indemnification obligations.</p><p><strong>8. Indemnification</strong></p><p>(a) <em>Indemnification by Jasper.</em> Jasper will defend and pay Customer, its employees, directors and officers (the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all costs, damages and expenses (collectively, “Losses”), suffered or incurred by any Customer Indemnified Party, as a result of any claim brought by a third party (“Third Party Claim”) against a Customer Indemnified Party alleging that the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement infringes any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret right of such third party (an “Infringement Claim”). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that any portion of the Services is likely to, in Jasper’s sole opinion, or does become the subject of an Infringement Claim, Jasper may, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the allegedly infringing item, (ii) substitute a functionally equivalent non-infringing replacement for such item, or (iii) modify such item to make it non-infringing and functionally equivalent, or (iv) terminate the Agreement and refund to Customer prepaid unused fees for the infringing items that Jasper received from Reseller. Jasper shall have no liability for any Infringement Claim to the extent arising from (1) Customer’s use or supply to Jasper of any Customer Property; (2) use of the Services in combination with any software, hardware, network or system not supplied by Jasper if the alleged infringement relates to such combination; (3) any modification or alteration of the Services (other than by Jasper); or (4) the Output, or (5) Customer’s violation of applicable law or third party rights.</p><p>(b) <em>Indemnification by Customer. </em>Customer will defend and pay Jasper, its employees, directors and officers (the “Jasper Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all Losses, suffered or incurred by any Jasper Indemnified Party, arising from any Third Party Claim against a Jasper Indemnified Party (i) alleging that any Customer Property or Customer’s use of the Services beyond the license granted in this Agreement infringes, violates or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trademark, publicity, trade secret or other intellectual property right of any third party or (ii) arising from Customer’s breach of the Platform Guidelines.</p><p>(c) <em>Indemnification Conditions.</em> The Parties’ obligations under this Section 8 are contingent upon the indemnified party (i) giving prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim subject to indemnification under this Section 8, (ii) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim, and (iii) cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). The indemnifying party shall not settle or consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim that adversely affects the rights or interests of the indemnified party without the prior express written consent of the indemnified party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The rights and remedies set forth in this Section 8 are the sole obligations of the indemnifying party and exclusive remedies available to the indemnified party in the event of an applicable Third Party Claim.</p><p><strong>9. Limitation of Liability</strong></p><p>(a) <em>Exclusion of Damages.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR BY ANY THIRD PERSON, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSS, DAMAGE OR INCONVENIENCE IS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p><p>(b) <em>Cap on Monetary Liability.</em> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL JASPER’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY JASPER FROM RESELLER IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES SOLD TO CUSTOMER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF A PARTY’S REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p><p>(c) <em>Exceptions</em>. The exclusions and limitations in Section 9(a) and 9(b) do not apply to (i) the Parties’ obligations under Section 6 (Confidentiality) or Section 8 (Indemnification), (ii) liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (iii) liability for Customer’s (1) use of the Services in violation of this Agreement, or (2) infringement of Jasper’s intellectual property rights in the Services.</p><p><strong>10. Term and Termination</strong></p><p>(a) <em>Term of Agreement.</em> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until terminated in accordance with Section 10(c).</p><p>(b) <em>Term of Subscriptions.</em> Customer’s access to the purchased Services shall commence on the start date specified in the relevant Order Form and continue for the Subscription Term specified on such Order Form.  </p><p>(c) <em>Termination. </em>Either Party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other Party in the event the other Party materially breaches any of its duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement and fails to: (i) cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt by the breaching Party of written notice specifying the breach, or (ii) if the breaching Party is incapable of curing such breach within thirty (30) days, provide the other Party with an acceptable plan for curing such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice and thereafter curing such breach in accordance with such plan. In addition, a Party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other Party if there are no Order Forms in effect for more than thirty (30) days, continuously.</p><p>(d) <em>Effect of Termination</em>. Expiration or termination of one Order Form shall not affect any other Order Forms. In the event of termination of this Agreement, Customer shall cease all use of the Services.</p><p>(e) <em>Surviving Provisions</em>. The following provisions shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in effect after any such termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3, 4(a), 4(b), 4(d), 6, 7(d), 8, 9, 10(d), 10(e), 11, and the Platform Guidelines. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect any obligation accrued or arising prior to such termination or expiration.</p><p><strong>11. Miscellaneous Provisions</strong></p><p>(a) <em>Relationship.</em> This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the Parties, and Jasper will be considered an independent contractor when performing any Services hereunder.</p><p>(b) <em>[Intentionally omitted]</em>  </p><p>(c) <em>Entire Understanding</em>. This Agreement (including the DPA (if applicable) and the Platform Guidelines) constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior proposals, marketing materials, negotiations and other written or oral communications between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in the body of this Agreement and any Order Form, the terms of Agreement shall prevail.  </p><p>(d) <em>Modification; Waiver</em>. Except for Jasper’s modification or update of the Documentation or the Service, or any policies as necessary to comply with applicable law, rules, regulations, no modification of this Agreement, and no waiver of any breach of this Agreement or right under this Agreement, is legally binding against the other Party unless in writing and signed or electronically accepted by both Parties. </p><p>(e) <em>Governing Law; Venue</em>. The parties hereto agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity hereof or thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Austin, Texas (except for an action for interim equitable relief otherwise permitted under this Agreement and/or unless otherwise agreed by the parties), before a sole arbitrator, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS (or its successor) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; provided, however, if the Parties mutually elect, the arbitration can be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures instead of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator’s decision shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator, and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The arbitrator or a court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ of execution to enforce the arbitrator’s judgment. Judgment may be entered upon such a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Parties will pay their own costs (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees) and expenses in connection with such arbitration.</p><p>(f) <em>Assignment</em>. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party; provided, however, a Party may assign this Agreement in its entirety, together with all rights and obligations hereunder, without consent of the other Party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to this Agreement. Any attempt by a Party to assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement in breach of this section shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p><p>(g) <em>Notices</em>. Except for notification methods expressly permitted under the Platform Guidelines, all notices under this Agreement to Customer shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the addresses provided by Customer to Jasper in writing. Notices to Jasper shall be addressed to: Jasper AI, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 3001 Bee Caves Rd., Suite 100 B, Rollingwood, TX 78746, with a copy to legal@jasper.ai. Either Party may change its address for notice by giving notice of such address change in the manner provided herein. All communications and notices to be made or given pursuant to this Agreement shall be in the English language.</p><p>(h) <em>Anti-Corruption</em>. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it has not received or been offered any illegal bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from the other Party in connection with this Agreement, other than reasonable gifts and entertainment provided in the ordinary course of business. Either Party will promptly notify the other Party if it offers or receives any such improper payment or transfer in connection with this Agreement.</p><p>(i) <em>Force Majeure</em>. Except for performance of a payment obligation, neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for delays, failures to perform, damages, losses or destruction, or malfunction of any equipment, or any consequence thereof, caused or occasioned by, or due to fire, earthquake, flood, water, the elements, labor disputes or shortages, utility curtailments, power failures, explosions, civil disturbances, governmental actions, epidemics, shortages of equipment or supplies, unavailability of transportation, acts or omissions of third parties, or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In the event any of the foregoing events results in Jasper not being able to provide the Services for a period of more than thirty (30) days, then either Party may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other Party.</p><p>(j) <em>Export Control</em>. The Service and related technical data and services (collectively, "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations and will not export or re-export any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S. law, nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required. All Controlled Technology is generally prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and any other country subject to relevant trade sanctions. </p><p>(l) <em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.</p>

Jasper shall not be liable to Customer for any such suspension or throttling of Customer’s access to the Services; provided, that Jasper uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with advance notice of such action.</li><li>   Except for legal notices of termination, material breach, force majeure or indemnification claims, Jasper may provide all business and product-related communications (e.g., release notes for product updates, privacy policy updates, critical security updates, and information on critical bugs and outages) to Customer by email, posting on the Services and/or other electronic means mutually agreed by the Parties. Jasper may rely and act on all information and instructions provided by Customer’s Users.</li><li>   Customer is solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining all rights, licenses, and credentials necessary to use Third Party Products in connection with the Services. In addition, Customer is solely responsible for installing, operating, updating, or otherwise maintaining the operation of such Third Party Products. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Jasper does not provide any warranties, guaranties or indemnification regarding any Third Party Products. If the availability of all or a portion of the Services depends on the corresponding availability of Third Party Products, Jasper’s sole responsibility will be to use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Services to ensure continued inter-operation with Third Party Products.  In no case are the providers of such Third Party Products Jasper’s third party service providers referenced in Section 6(d) of the Agreement.<br><br><br></li></ol>

                        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Platform Guidelines</strong></p><ol><li>The Services are powered by generative artificial intelligence. Given the rapidly evolving nature of this technology, the Services may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts. Customer acknowledges that it and its Users should scrutinize the veracity of any information included in Output from the Services. To the extent that Customer or its Users relies upon such information’s factual accuracy, Customer acknowledges that it does so entirely at its own risk.</li><li>Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form, (i) each User will be assigned a unique user identification name and password (“User ID”) for access to and use of the Services, and (ii) User IDs are intended for use by the designated Users only and cannot be shared. Customer agrees to provide accurate, current and complete account and User information. Customer is responsible for ensuring the security and confidentiality of all User IDs assigned to Customer and its Users. As a part of the Service, Users are given the ability to add other Users to their accounts and enable other Users to access or modify Customer Property included in such account. Customer is solely responsible for managing which Users have access to such Customer Property and for any actions taken by such Users with respect to Customer’s account and Customer Property.</li><li>Jasper is not responsible for the content submitted by Customer or its Users to the Services (“Content”). Customer is solely responsible for the Content and for all activity that occurs under its account. Customer and its Users may not transmit any Content that is unlawful, offensive, upsetting, intended to disgust, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. Examples of such objectionable Content include, but are not limited to, Content that is: (i) unlawful or promotes unlawful activity; (ii) defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups; (iii) spam, machine – or randomly – generated, constituting unauthorized or unsolicited advertising, chain letters, any other form of unauthorized solicitation, or any form of lottery or gambling; (v) infringing on any proprietary rights of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, publicity or other rights; (vi) impersonating any person or entity including Jasper and its employees or representatives; (vii) violating the privacy of any third person; (viii) false; or (ix) sexual, religious or political in nature. The Company reserves the right, but does not have any obligation, to, in its sole discretion, determine whether or not any Content is appropriate and complies with this Agreement, and to refuse or remove such Content. Jasper further reserves the right to make formatting changes, edits, and otherwise modify any Content. Jasper can also limit or revoke the use of the Service if Customer or any User posts such objectionable Content. As Jasper cannot control all content posted by users and/or third parties on the Service, Customer agrees to use the Service at its own risk. Customer acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Users, that by using the Service Users may be exposed to content that they may find offensive, indecent, incorrect, or objectionable, and under no circumstances shall Jasper be liable in any way for any content, including any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of Customer’s or any User’s use of any content.</li><li>Except for uses that are expressly permitted (for example, in the Documentation or in an Order Form), Customer will not, and will ensure that Users do not: (i) sell, resell, rent, lease, or otherwise distribute any portion of the Service; (ii) use the Services other than in accordance with the Documentation or in a manner that interferes with, unduly burdens, or disrupts the integrity, performance, or availability of the Service (for example, by conducting load tests or penetration tests without Jasper’s prior written consent); (iii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or to Jasper’s or its third party suppliers’ related systems or networks; (iv) access any portion of the Services for the purpose of building a similar or competitive product or service, or monitor the Services for any benchmarking or competitive purpose; (v) introduce, disseminate, or otherwise enable any viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, worms, malware, spam, or malicious code using the Service; (vi) copy, modify, translate, or create a derivative work of any Jasper Property; (vii) ) reverse assemble, reverse compile, decompile, translate or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying components of models, algorithms, and systems included in the Jasper Property (except to the extent such restrictions are contrary to applicable law); (viii) except for contact information consisting of first name, last name, IP address and email address for which Customer has obtained necessary rights of access and use from the individual, Customer agrees not to submit other Personal Data or any sensitive personal information (including government issued identification numbers, financial account information, payment card information, and personal health information) to the Services; (ix) mislead any person that the Output from the Services was human generated; (x) use the Services to generate spam, content for dissemination in electoral campaigns, content that encourages violence, terrorism, or other serious harm or (xi) alter, remove or violate any copyright or other intellectual property notice appearing in connection with the Services. Customer may not access the Services if it is a direct competitor of Jasper, except with Jasper’s prior written consent.</li><li>If applicable to Customer’s subscription, Customer shall use the Authorized APIs in accordance with the Documentation, and will promptly correct any usage of Authorized APIs that does not comply with the Documentation. Authentication Keys must be restricted to use by authorized personnel of Customer who have a need to use it for purposes of integrating the Services with other web applications. Customer is solely responsible for maintaining the security of all Authentication Keys and for all activities that occur using any Authentication Key issued to Customer and must promptly notify Jasper of any unauthorized use. The Authentication Keys are the property of Jasper and may be revoked by Jasper in connection with any permitted suspension of Customer’s right to use an Authorized API.</li><li>A high-speed Internet connection is required for proper transmission of the Services. Customer is responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect Customer’s network to the Services, including, but not limited to, “browser” software that supports protocols used by Jasper, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol or other protocols accepted by Jasper, and to follow procedures for accessing services that support such protocols. Jasper is not responsible for notifying Customer or its Users of any upgrades, fixes or enhancements to any such software or for any compromise of data, including Customer Property, transmitted across computer networks or telecommunications facilities (including but not limited to the Internet) which are not owned, operated or controlled by Jasper. Jasper assumes no responsibility for the reliability or performance of any connections as described in this section.</li><li>Jasper will process and investigate proper notices of alleged copyright or other intellectual property infringement related to material submitted through Customer’s account, and will respond appropriately, following the guidelines of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act and other applicable intellectual property laws. Customer agrees to use the Services in a manner that will not violate any third party copyright, trade secret, publicity, trademark, or any other intellectual property rights.</li><li>Jasper reserves the right to monitor the use of the Services for security and operational purposes and make modifications to the features and functionality of the Services during the Subscription Term. Jasper may immediately suspend or throttle access to the Services if (i) Jasper reasonably believes that a User or Customer is in breach of this Agreement; (ii) a User or Customer engages in excessive utilization of the Services which affects, or could reasonably likely (in Jasper’s opinion) affect, system availability or performance, or (iii) if Jasper in good faith suspects that any third party has gained unauthorized access to the Services using a credential issued by Jasper to Customer or its Users. In addition, Jasper may temporarily suspend access to the Services during planned downtime for upgrades and maintenance (of which Jasper will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Users notice in accordance with paragraph 9 below). Jasper shall not be liable to Customer, any Users or any other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuation of Customer’s rights to access and use the Services.</li><li>Artificial intelligence and machine learning models can improve over time to better address specific use cases. Customer agrees and instructs that as part of providing and maintaining the Services, Jasper may use Customer Property to develop and improve the Services. This improvement may involve sending select portions of Customer Property to third-party contractors (subject to confidentiality and security obligations which are substantially consistent with those set forth in this Agreement) solely for the purpose of providing data annotation services to Jasper and its third-party service providers in connection with Jasper’s operation of the Services, with Jasper being responsible for all actions and omissions of such contractors. For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer Property will not be used except as described in this paragraph or Section 4(c) of the Agreement. In addition, Customer acknowledges that due to the nature of machine learning, the Output may not be unique and the Services may generate the same or similar output for Jasper or a third party.</li><li>Jasper may use data concerning Customer’s or its Users’ use of the Services in an aggregated and anonymous manner (“Usage Information”), including but not limited to compiling statistical and performance information related to the operation of the Services. Jasper shall have the right to use Customer Property to improve the Service and to develop additional offerings. The foregoing shall not limit, in any way, Jasper’s confidentiality obligations as set forth in Section 6 of the Agreement. Customer agrees that Jasper may make such information publicly available, provided that (i) such information does not incorporate any Customer Property and (ii) such use does not identify Customer or any Users either directly or indirectly. Jasper retains all intellectual property rights in Usage Information.</li><li>Except for legal notices of termination, material breach, force majeure or indemnification claims, Jasper may provide all business and product-related communications (e.g., release notes for product updates, privacy policy updates, critical security updates, and information on critical bugs and outages) to Customer by email, posting on the Services and/or other electronic means. Jasper may rely and act on all information and instructions provided by Customer’s Users.</li><li>Customer is solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining all rights, licenses, and credentials necessary to use Third Party Products. In addition, Customer is solely responsible for installing, operating, updating, or otherwise maintaining the operation of such Third Party Products. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Jasper does not provide any warranties, guaranties or indemnification regarding any Third Party Products, whether or not such products or services are designated by Jasper as “certified,” “validated” or otherwise. Jasper does not have any responsibility or liability for any exchange of data or other interaction occurring directly between Customer or its Users and any provider of a Third Party Product. If the availability of all or a portion of the Services depends on the corresponding availability of Third Party Products, Jasper will not be liable to Customer if changes in Third Party Products cause the unavailability of all or a portion of the Services. However, Jasper will use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Services to ensure continued inter-operation with Third Party Products. Further, Customer acknowledges and agrees that if it gives a Third Party Product access to its Jasper account, Customer shall serve as the controller of such information and the Third Party Service Provider serves as the processor for purposes of those data laws and regulations that apply to Customer. In no case are such Third Party Service Providers Jasper’s Subprocessors.</li><li>Customer acknowledges that the Services utilize services provided to Jasper by OpenAI, LLC (“OpenAI”), which are governed by, among other things, OpenAI’s <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines"><u>Usage Guidelines</u></a>, <a href="https://openai.com/api/policies/sharing-publication/"><u>Sharing &amp; Publication Policy</u></a>, <a href="https://openai.com/api/policies/community-guidelines/"><u>Community Guidelines</u></a>, and <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines/content-policy"><u>Content Policy</u></a> (collectively, the OpenAI Policies). Customer shall not use the Services in a manner which shall cause Jasper to be in violation of any OpenAI Policy. In addition, Customer shall comply with Jasper’s <a href="https://help.jasper.ai/article/269-fair-use-policy"><u>Fair Use Policy</u></a> and is otherwise prohibited from engaging in abnormally high usage. For any illegal activity of sharing login details of your account with others, Customer’s account may be blocked or permanently deleted without any notice. No claim of any sort in this regard will be accepted and no refunds will be issued. By using the Services, Customer acknowledges and agrees that any claims/disputes in this regard raised by Customer or by its bank will be automatically rejected.</li></ol>

Upon reaching both milestones, you will receive the increased Commission for the following 12-month period for all net new Customers.

An Affiliate Lead is not considered valid if it’s first click on the Affiliate Link is after this Agreement has expired or terminated.</span></span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><u>e.

                        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Jasper Affiliate Partner Terms and Conditions</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Effective January 24, 2022</em></p><div><br></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Jasper may offer you an opportunity to become an independent Jasper Affiliate (“Affiliate”), wherein you have the opportunity to earn additional money for Jasper products, services, and accounts that you sell. Jasper reserves the sole and exclusive right to determine the amount of remuneration each Affiliate will receive in exchange for the Affiliate’s efforts.  Affiliate commission is further discussed herein. See also Jasper<a href="https://www.jasper.ai/terms"><u> Terms of Service</u></a>, which apply to you in your role as Affiliate, unless otherwise expressly provided for.  </p><p style="text-align: justify;">This Affiliate Agreement (“Agreement”) governs Your application for, and any subsequent participation in, Jasper’ Affiliate program. By clicking “I Accept the Terms and Conditions” and submit, You thereby accept the terms of this Agreement, You indicate that You have read and understood this Agreement, and agree that You are bound by its terms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 1 - PARTIES </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‍</strong>All references to “Jasper” herein means and refers to Jasper, INC., doing business as Jasper.  All references to “You” and “Your” mean and refer to the person or entity who has executed this Agreement.  Jasper and You are each referred to herein as a “Party,” and collectively as the “Parties.” You agree to notify us in writing if the legal name of your business or account ownership changes within twenty-four (24) hours of such change and You certify that all such information is truthful and accurate. Notice of such changes should be sent to partners@jasper.ai.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 2 - APPLICATION</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‍</strong>You agree to provide all information requested by Jasper in connection with Your Affiliate application, and You affirm that all information that You provide is truthful and accurate. You understand and agree that Jasper retains sole and exclusive discretion to determine whether You qualify for participation in Jasper’ Affiliate program. Not everyone who applies for Jasper’s Affiliate program will qualify to participate. The application to become an affiliate can be found at<a href="https://partners.jarvis.ai/"><u> https://partners.jasper.ai/</u></a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 3 - CONSENT TO BE CONTACTED‍</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">You expressly consent to be contacted at the email address, social media, and the phone number You provide in Your application about Your application and the Affiliate program, including through automated dialing systems, texts and artificial or pre-recorded messages. This consent is a material condition of this Agreement and may not be revoked except in writing by both Parties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 4 - COMPENSATION‍</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If Your application to become an Affiliate is approved by Jasper, You will receive a unique Affiliate ID. The Affiliate ID will be incorporated within each URL which You will use to advertise Jasper. You will have the opportunity to receive a commission for each sale (“Sale”) that is registered using Your Affiliate ID.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a prospect (“Prospect”) has multiple Affiliate cookies (“Cookies”), the most recently-acquired Cookie will determine which Affiliate is credited with a Sale. There are some products and services sold that do not have trial periods.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that the Sold Account (as defined below) remains in good status within thirty (30) days from the Sale, You will be paid a commission for each Sold Account that generates a payment to Jasper in a month (“Commission”). Except as otherwise provided herein, Commission payments will be paid in the first week of each month following Jasper’ receipt of payment for a Sold Account, subject to the other terms of this Agreement. All Commission payments are based on the amount of fees received by Jasper, less sales taxes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">*You will earn 30% commissions on the self serve plans (Creator and Teams) purchased by your referral for as long as they are a customer. If they pay monthly, you’ll be paid 30% of their monthly payment. If they pay annual, you will receive 30% of their annual payment as commission. If they upgrade or downgrade, your commission will match the new payment at 30% accordingly. If they cancel, you will stop receiving commissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The customized "Business Plan" is non-commissionable. If your referral begins on Creator or Teams and upgrades to Business, commissions will discontinue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">All Commissions are paid in U.S. Dollars (USD) or otherwise in currencies offered by the payment provider.  Some payment methods may incur processing fees that may be deducted from Your Commissions payment. Your Commission must equal or exceed Twenty Five Dollars ($25.00) (USD) before You receive a payment from Jasper.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Once a Commission of $25 (USD) or more is earned, You will need to register with our third-party payment provider, PayPal.com, to receive payment of Commissions. This means You are authorizing third party companies to contact You.  Before You can be paid any Commission, You must provide PayPal or Wise a completed W-8 or W-9 tax form, as well as any supporting documentation requested by Jasper or its third-party payment provider. You are solely responsible for complying with all tax laws in Your respective jurisdiction(s) including, but not limited to, the payment of all required taxes, and filing of all returns and other required documents with, the applicable governing body(ies).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">*Commission rates and subject to change at anytime.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Non Commissionable Behavior</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Affiliates will not be paid any Commissions for payments made on Affiliate’s own user account(s). Affiliates are not permitted to open a Jasper account under the name of another person or entity, under a fictitious name, or under any name merely for the purpose of obtaining Commissions.  Affiliates may not pay for another person’s or entity’s account. Affiliates are not permitted to offer cash rebates or other monetary incentives to obtain sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Commissions are paid only for transactions that actually occur between Jasper and a Sale in which payment is received by Jasper.  If payment for a Sold Account later results in a refund or chargeback, and if a Commission was paid to You for that Sold Account, then the Commission will be deducted from Your future Commissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it is found that a sale came from paid traffic on search engines including Google or Bing targeting Jasper’ branded and trademarked keywords, Affiliate will be in violation of this agreement and commissions will NOT be paid and Affiliate’s link will be banned, making it no longer possible for Affiliate to track referrals and receive commissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you are running search ads on Google or Bing, you must set negative keywords for "jasper", "Jasper", "jasper.ai", "jasper ai", "conversion ai", "Conversion.ai", and "conversion.ai".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it is found that the traffic sent to the Jasper website is bot traffic or malicious in behavior, Affiliate will be in violation of this agreement and commissions will NOT be paid and Affiliate’s link will be banned, making it no longer possible for Affiliate to track referrals and receive commissions. This traffic is recognized by server errors or high traffic with extremely low conversion rates, often sent from bad ad networks or purchased email lists.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it is found that Affiliate is emailing purchased lists or people who have not opted-in to be contacted, or sending direct messages to people on social media soliciting Jasper without the person's consent, Affiliate will be in violation of this agreement and commissions will NOT be paid and Affiliate’s link will be banned, making it no longer possible for Affiliate to track referrals and receive commissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>If Jasper determines, in its sole and exclusive discretion, that any Sale was procured fraudulently or as a result of any violation of this Agreement or applicable law, no Commission will be paid for such Sale, and for past sales, such payment amounts shall be deducted from Your future Commissions, and Jasper may terminate this Agreement immediately without Jasper having any liability to You.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 5 - TERM AND TERMINATION </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‍</strong>The term of this Agreement will begin the earlier of (i) when You click “I accept the Terms and Conditions” and submit; or (ii) Your participation in the Affiliate program is approved. Your participation in the Jasper Affiliate program will continue month-to-month until terminated. Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other Party written notice of termination. If, in our sole discretion, You fail, or we suspect that You have failed, to comply with any term or provision of the Agreement or the Terms of Service, or violated any law, whether in connection with Your use of Jasper or otherwise, we may terminate the Agreement or suspend Your access to the Affiliate website (“Website”) at any time without notice to You. If it is found you are running ads for branded keywords on Google or Bing, including Jasper, Jasper.ai, Conversion.ai, you are in violation of this agreement and we may terminate your account and not pay commissions on sales. In addition, if, based on our data, you have a dispute rate greater than 10%, we may terminate this Agreement or suspend your access to the Website at any time without notice to You. In such instances, and in our sole discretion, we may also for the aforementioned reasons, terminate our relationship and suspend any accounts owned/controlled by You. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limitation for purposes of the foregoing, any violation of the required disclosure will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement. See Appendix A, Section 2, Disclosure. In the event this Agreement is canceled due to Your breach, You immediately forfeit all Commissions, Bonuses, and any other payments owed to You or that may in the future be owed to You without any further liability by Jasper to You. <strong>This Agreement will terminate automatically if You earn no (zero) Commissions over a 12 month period.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If this Agreement is terminated or canceled, then all provisions that, by their nature, should survive, will survive, including, but not necessarily limited to, all limitations of liability, disclaimers of warranties, indemnity obligations, mandatory arbitration, and class action waiver provisions, and exceptions to arbitration.  All representations and warranties undertaken by You shall also survive termination or cancellation of this Agreement and/or Your Jasper account.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SECTION 6 - ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  </strong>In addition to Your other representations and warranties herein, You further represent and warrant that there are no prior or pending government investigations or inquiries of, or prosecutions against You by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), any other federal or state governmental agency, or any industry regulatory authority, anywhere in the world, nor any prior or pending private lawsuits against You which relate to alleged intentional torts or alleged violation of any consumer protection or advertising laws.

Without limiting the foregoing, Reseller may not market, advertise or resell the Offerings through any online store, except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law.</p><p>3.3. <em>Identification as Reseller</em>. During the Term, subject to this Agreement and any quality standards and usage guidelines that Jasper specifically prescribes (including the Brand Guidelines available at https://www.jasper.ai/brand), Jasper grants Reseller the right to use Jasper’s Brand Elements solely in connection with identifying yourself as a Jasper “Reseller” in connection with your authorized resale of the Offerings. Reseller will not advertise or market Jasper’s Offerings without clearly identifying Jasper as the developer or provider of such Offerings.

Jasper may permit its Affiliates and subcontractors to exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, but remains responsible for its overall performance under this Agreement.</p><p>3.6. <em>Separate Corporate Reseller Program</em>. Placing an Order for the resale of the Offerings under this Agreement does not enroll you in Jasper’s Tech Partner or Solutions Partner Programs. For more information on these programs, visit the Jasper Partner Pages at https://www.jasper.ai/partners/tech-partnerships or https://www.jasper.ai/partners/solutions. </p><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>CONDUCT AND OBLIGATIONS</strong></p><p>4.1. <em>Reseller Conduct</em>. Reseller will represent Jasper and the Offerings in a positive and professional manner at all times. Reseller shall ensure that any personnel who will be performing activities under this Agreement, prior to such performance, have satisfactorily completed a background investigation, reasonable for the given role, and subject to applicable law. Reseller will not (a) disparage the Offerings, (b) represent itself as an agent or employee of Jasper, (c) engage in any misleading, deceptive, illegal, or unethical conduct in connection with its performance under this Agreement, or (d) make any representations, guarantees, warranties or commitments regarding the Offerings: (i) in addition to or inconsistent with those in the product descriptions provided by Jasper with respect to the Offerings or (ii) on Jasper’s behalf. If Reseller breaches this Section 4.1, without limiting its other remedies, Jasper may terminate this Agreement with 10 days’ prior notice.</p><p>4.2. <em>Customer Agreements and Warranties</em>. Each Customer’s access to and use of the Offerings is subject to the applicable Customer Agreement. Reseller is responsible for ensuring each Customer has entered such Customer Agreement, at or before such Customer’s purchase or use of the Offerings, in a manner that is legally binding upon the Customer. Upon written request by Jasper, Reseller will promptly deliver to Jasper evidence of each Customer’s executed Customer Agreement. Reseller agrees to immediately notify Jasper of any known or suspected breach of a Customer Agreement or other unauthorized use of the Offerings and to assist Jasper in the enforcement of the terms of each Customer Agreement. Jasper makes any warranties regarding the Offerings directly to the Customer as set forth in the Customer Agreement, and any refund provided as a remedy for such warranties will be provided in accordance with Section 7.7 (Customer Refunds and Service Credits). For clarity, Reseller has no authority to (and may not) alter, remove or negotiate the terms of the Customer Agreement.</p><p>4.3. <em>Reseller Services</em>. Reseller has no rights under this Agreement to provide training or other services to Customer in connection with their use of the Offerings (“<strong>Reseller Services</strong>”).</p><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>RESELLER ACCESS TO OFFERINGS</strong></p><p>5.1. <em>Access Through Customer Accounts</em>. If Reseller receives access to Offerings directly from a Customer (e.g., in Reseller’s capacity as a contractor of Customer), then Reseller’s access or use of any Offering on behalf of a Customer will remain subject to the applicable Customer Agreement between Jasper and such Customer, with Reseller as an “Authorized User” (or other applicable end user) of such Customer under the Customer Agreement.</p><p>5.2. <em>No Other Access; Separate Agreements</em>. Except as expressly provided in this Section 5, Reseller receives no other access to the Offerings in connection with this Agreement. If Reseller purchases any Offerings for its own use, its use of such Offerings will be governed by the Customer Agreement between Reseller and Jasper and not this Agreement.</p><p><strong>6. OWNERSHIP</strong></p><p>6.1. <em>Reservation of Rights and Ownership</em>. Neither Party grants the other Party any rights or licenses not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Offerings (including any content or information contained therein) and all copies thereof are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Jasper and its suppliers have and will retain all rights, title and interest (including all patent rights, copyrights, trade secret rights, trademarks, service marks, related goodwill and confidential and proprietary information) in and to its Brand Elements (including all goodwill arising from their use), the Offerings, any underlying software and all copies, improvements, updates, modifications and enhancements of the foregoing (including any changes which incorporate any Feedback, as defined in Section 6.2 (Feedback)), and Reseller does not acquire any rights of ownership in any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding any use of terms such as “purchase”, “sale” or likewise hereunder, all Offerings are offered by Jasper on a license or subscription basis only. </p><p>6.2. <em>Feedback</em>. If Reseller provides Jasper with feedback about the Offerings (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”), Jasper may use the feedback without restriction. For clarity, this use right applies to any Feedback Reseller submits to Jasper that was originally provided to Reseller by a Customer. All Feedback is provided “AS IS”. </p><p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>ORDERS AND PAYMENT</strong></p><p>7.1. <em>Orders</em>. In order to resell an Offering and prior to committing to provide an Offering to any Customer, Reseller must place an Order with Jasper specifying the Offerings that Reseller will resell, the applicable Customer and corresponding contact information, and the Customer’s Scope of Use. No Order will be binding until accepted by Jasper in its sole discretion (or otherwise in writing).  Any Order placed by Reseller must correspond to an applicable order form by Customer for the Offerings and associated Scope of Use. Any additional or different terms in Reseller’s order form with the Customer will not be binding upon Jasper and Reseller will be solely liable for any claims arising from such terms. Accepted Orders are non-cancellable by Reseller, except to the extent otherwise set forth herein or in an Order. Jasper may collect and use certain data and information in connection with Reseller’s placement of an Order in accordance with the Privacy Policy. </p><p>7.2. <em>Price and Payment</em>. Each Order will set forth the Offerings and List Price. Reseller will pay all amounts due under this Agreement in United States Dollars, unless Jasper designates another currency at the time of the Order. Payment is due when you submit your Order.</p><p>7.3. <em>Customer Pricing; Collection</em>. Reseller will independently determine the pricing at which it offers the Offerings to Customers. Reseller will be solely responsible for collecting all fees from Customers. Non-payment by Customers will not relieve Reseller of its obligation to pay fees to Jasper. Jasper reserves the right to cancel or suspend provision of the Offerings with respect to any Customer if it fails to receive payment from Reseller with respect to such Customer.</p><p>7.4. <em>Delivery</em>. Jasper will deliver license keys, access keys or login or other instructions for access to the Offerings directly to the Customer contact specified in Reseller’s Order in accordance with our standard delivery procedures. Jasper will not deliver any Offerings covered by an Order to Reseller.</p><p>7.5. <em>Taxes</em>. Amounts payable by Reseller under this Agreement for Offerings exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Offerings in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by Jasper, Reseller must pay to Jasper the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any amounts owed under this Agreement for the Offering at the time of the Order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Reseller may have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed. In such event, Reseller may provide to Jasper any such exemption information, and Jasper will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as may enable Reseller to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid by Jasper from any relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available. However, Jasper will have no refund or credit obligation itself under this Section 7.5.</p><p>7.6. <em>Records and Audit</em>. Reseller will maintain complete, clear and accurate records of its transactions and performance under this Agreement, including evidence of each Customer’s entry into the Customer Agreement. Upon 10 days’ advance written notice, Reseller will permit Jasper or its representative to audit Reseller’s records to ensure Reseller’s compliance with this Agreement. Any such audit will be conducted during normal business hours and in a manner designed to cause minimal impact on Reseller’s ordinary business activities. Reseller will maintain all records required under this Agreement for at least 3 years following expiration or termination of the Agreement.</p><p>7.7. <em>Customer Refunds and Service Credits</em>. If a Customer exercises its right under the applicable Customer Agreement to terminate an order to seek a refund or service credit, Reseller will promptly notify Jasper and provide Jasper with evidence of the Customer’s request. Jasper may, in its sole discretion: (a) issue the appropriate refund or service credit directly to the Customer in lieu of a refund or service credit to Reseller or (b) issue the refund or service credit to Reseller, which refund or service credit Reseller will promptly revert to the Customer. Other than as set forth in this Section 7.7, Jasper will not issue any refunds or service credits to Reseller under this Agreement. </p><p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER</strong></p><p>8.1. <em>Warranties</em>.

Reseller will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Jasper and its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents from and against any third-party claim brought against such Jasper parties, and any resulting losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), to the extent arising from or relating to: (a) your breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or your conduct in connection with resale or marketing of the Offerings, (b) your issuance of any warranty or representation regarding Jasper or its Offerings not specified in the Customer Agreement, or (c) your breach of Section 4.3 “Reseller Services”.</p><p>9.2. <em>Procedures</em>. Reseller’s obligations in this Section 9 are subject to receiving (a) prompt written notice of the claim, (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement of the claim and (c) all reasonably necessary cooperation of the indemnified Party, at the indemnifying Party’s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs. The indemnifying Party may not settle a claim without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) if the settlement would require the indemnified Party to admit fault or take or refrain from taking any action (other than ceasing use or sale of infringing materials, when Jasper is the indemnifying Party). The indemnified Party may participate in the defense of any claim with its own counsel at its own expense.</p><p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>10.1. <em>Definition</em>. “<strong>Confidential Information</strong>” means information disclosed under this Agreement that is designated by the disclosing Party as proprietary or confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be proprietary or confidential due to its nature and the circumstances of its disclosure. Jasper’s Confidential Information includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offerings, any technical or performance information about the Offerings, any non-public documentation provided by Jasper and any new product information regarding the Offerings.</p><p>10.2. <em>Obligations</em>. As receiving Party, each Party will (a) hold the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose such Confidential Information to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement and (b) only use such Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement. The receiving Party may disclose the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this Section 10 and they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 10.</p><p>10.3. <em>Exclusions</em>. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that the receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving Party, (b) it rightfully knew or possessed prior to receipt under this Agreement, (c) it rightfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality obligations or (d) it independently developed without using the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

Unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone are an insufficient remedy. Each Party may seek appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies, for breach or threatened breach of this Section 10. </p><p><strong>11.</strong> <strong>TERM AND TERMINATION</strong></p><p>11.1. <em>Term</em>. This Agreement will begin on the date of the applicable Order accepted by Jasper ("Reseller Acceptance").

Upon any Expiration, Reseller will (a) cease to be an authorized reseller of Offerings, (b) immediately cease all advertising, marketing and other resale activities with respect to the Offerings, (c) cease use of the Offerings to the extent permitted under the Agreement, and any Brand Elements or other Jasper resources provided under this Agreement and destroy any and all copies of such Offerings and Brand Elements, (d) immediately pay Jasper any outstanding unpaid amounts and (e) pay Jasper the amounts, if any, which come due under any Order accepted prior to the date of termination as such amounts come due. In addition, upon any Expiration, each Party will return or destroy (at the other Party’s option) any Confidential Information of the other Party in its possession or control, provided that each Party may maintain reasonable copies to the extent required by applicable law or for archiving purposes in accordance with its record retention policies. </p><p>11.4. <em>Customer Agreements</em>. Any Customer licenses or subscriptions granted prior to the termination of the Agreement will survive in accordance with the terms of the applicable Customer Agreement, provided that in no event may such licenses be extended or renewed without the prior written consent of Jasper. The Parties agree to continue cooperating to carry out an orderly termination of their relationship, and to the extent a Customer desires to purchase Offerings (including renewals and increasing user tiers) following termination of the Agreement, Reseller will refer the Customer to Jasper and fully cooperate with Jasper in connection therewith. Jasper will have no liability to Reseller of any type arising from termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. To the extent a Customer notifies Reseller or Jasper that it wishes to terminate an order with Reseller prior to the Subscription Term End Date as set forth in such order with Reseller in accordance with the Customer's terms with the Reseller, and purchase Offerings through another Jasper reseller or Jasper, then Reseller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Jasper  in transferring applicable access or other requisite rights to the Offerings under the terminated Order to Customer or Customer’s selected alternate reseller.</p><p>11.5. <em>Survival</em>.
