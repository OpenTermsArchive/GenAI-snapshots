Murf Inc. shall remain liable under the respective Principles if its agent processes such Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles unless Murf Inc. shows it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murf Inc. may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</span></p><h5><strong>Legal Disclosures</strong></h5><p>It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to</p><p>(1) Investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies;</p><p>(2) Enforce our agreements with you;</p><p>(3) Investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations;</p><p>(4) Protect the security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or</p><p>(5) Exercise or protect the rights and safety of our users, personnel or others.

We will respond to all requests within 30 days. Please note that deleting your personal information may limit our ability to provide the service to you.</p><p>We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, including without limitation where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case question, where the rights of other persons would be violated or as required by law or governance purposes.</p><p>If you need further assistance regarding your access and control of your personal information, please contact us.</p><h5><strong>Security</strong></h5><p>We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS.
